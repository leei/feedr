<description>The deceit and propaganda which justify both wars are identical, as are the harms they cause</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>On November 2, Californians will vote on Proposition 19, a referendum which (roughly speaking) would legalize marijuana. I have <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43544.html">an Op-Ed in <em>Politico</em> today</a> (a phrase I never expected to write)&#160;on the resounding success of drug decriminalization in Portugal and how that empirical data should affect the California debate. That Op-Ed is based on the <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10080">comprehensive report I wrote</a> for the Cato Institute after conducting research in Portugal in late 2008, documenting how decriminalization has single-handedly enabled that country to manage, control and even reduce the problems associated with drug usage far more effectively than other nations (<u>i.e.</u>, other EU&#160;states and the U.S.) which continue to criminalize drugs.</p>
  <p>I&#8217;m convinced that drug prohibition, and especially the "War on Drugs" which enables it, is going to be one of those policies which, decades from now, future generations will be completely unable to understand how we could have tolerated.&#160; So irrational and empirically false are the justifications for drug prohibition, and so costly is the War waged in its name, that it is difficult to imagine a more counter-productive policy than this (that's why public opinion is <a href="http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/37790/most_americans_support_legalizing_marijuana/">inexorably realizing this</a> despite decades of Drug&#160;War propaganda and the absence of any real advocacy for decriminalization on the part of national political leaders).&#160; In that regard, and in virtually every other, the War on Drugs is a mirror image of the War on Terror:&#160; sustained with the same deceitful propaganda, driven by many of the same motives, prosecuted with similar templates, and destructive in many of the same ways.</p>
  <p>The similarities are obvious.&#160; Both wars rely upon cartoon depictions of Scary Villains (The Drug Kingpin, Mexican Cartels, the Terrorist Mastermind) to keep the population in a state of heightened fear and thus blind them to rational discourse.&#160; But both wars are not only complete failures in eradicating those villains, but they both do more to empower those very villains than any other single cause -- the War on Drugs by <a href="http://justsaynow.firedoglake.com/2010/10/12/rand-study-marijuana-legalization-would-markedly-cut-mexican-drug-cartel-profits/">ensuring that cartels&#8217; profits from the illegal drug trade remain sky-high</a>, and the War on Terror by <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/12/terrorism/index.html">ensuring more and more support and recruits for anti-American extremists</a>.&#160; And both, separately and together, endlessly erode basic American liberties by convincing a frightened public that they can Stay Safe only if they cede more and more power to the state.&#160; Many of the civil liberties erosions from the War on Terror have their genesis in the War on Drugs.</p>
  <p>The most important commonality between these two wars is that they continue -- and will continue -- for reasons having nothing to do with their stated justifications.&#160; Both wars ensure an unlimited stream of massive amounts of money into the private war-making industries which fuel them.&#160; By itself, the increasingly privatized American prison industry -- fed a <a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/cs/censusstatistic/a/aaprisonpop.htm">constant stream of human beings put in cages as a result of drug prohibition laws</a> -- is <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=8289">obscenely profitable</a>.&#160; Add to these powerful profit centers the political fear that officials have of being perceived as abandoning any war before it is "won," and these two intrinsically unwinnable wars -- unwinnable by design -- seem destined to endure forever, or at least until some sort of major financial collapse simply permits them no longer.</p>
  <p>It's the perfect deceit.&#160; These wars, in an endless loop, sustain and strengthen the very menaces which, in turn, justify their continuous escalation.&#160; These wars manufacture the very dangers they are ostensibly designed to combat.&#160; Meanwhile, the industries which fight them become richer and richer.&#160; The political officials those industries own become more and more powerful.&#160; Brutal drug cartels monopolize an unimaginably profitable, no-competition industry, while Terrorists are continuously supplied the perfect rationale for persauding huge numbers of otherwise unsympathetic people to join them or support them.&#160; Everyone wins -- except for ordinary citizens, who become poorer and poorer, more and more imprisoned, meeker and meeker, and less and less free.</p>

<description>The press secretary now decries concealed campaign funders -- but was once a champion of it</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/10/axelrod_well_keep_pounding_out.html">controversy over Chamber of Commerce election funding</a> raises a very real and important&#160; issue: &#160;the genuine threat posed to our political system by unknown funders who can pour massive amounts of money into negative ads while hiding who they are.&#160; The White House's arguments about the need for more disclosure are largely correct, although that legitimate issue has been obscured by reckless, sloppy and somewhat McCarthyite behavior in accusing the Chamber of Commerce -- <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vote-2010-foreign-money-us-chamber-commerce-ads/story?id=11853117">with no evidence whatsoever</a> -- of using nefarious "foreign money" to pay for these ads, and then demanding that the Chamber reveal its funders in order to prove its innocence.&#160; That is lamentable both because guilty-until-proven-innocent attacks are inherently misguided, and more so, because that attack has obscured the genuine issue over the dangers posed by undisclosed sources of campaign money.</p>
  <p>But even regarding the White House's legitimate arguments about disclosure, there is some major hypocrisy taking place.&#160;&#160;White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs has been leading the charge against the Chamber, citing what he called "the spirit of disclosure" when <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2010/10/12/gibbs_chamber_should_release_donors_in_spirit_of_political_disclosure.html">telling CBS'&#160;Mark Knoller this earlier this week</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I think it's important when you don't know - when you don't know who those people are, when you don't know what their agenda is. I think as the president has said that it is a threat very fundamentally to our democracy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But what makes it so infuriating to watch Gibbs make this argument is that Gibbs himself -- back in 2003 and 2004 -- was heavily involved in exactly the same kind of anonymous-funded negative campaign the Chamber is running now, when the brand-new advocacy group for which he was the spokesman invoked the same excuses as the Chamber is invoking now to conceal its donors.&#160; As <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/12/spirit-of-political-disclosure-white-house-press-sec-once-part-of-group-that-refused-to-disclose-donors/">Chris Moody recalls</a>, when Howard Dean was the 2004 Democratic front-runner, a new group abruptly popped up -- calling itself "Americans for&#160;Jobs, Health Care and Progressive Values" -- and, shortly before the Iowa primary, began running an extremely ugly anti-Dean TV ad campaign, featuring images of Osama bin Laden, along with ominous claims that Howard Dean would fail to Keep Us Safe, that he could not "compete with George&#160;Bush on foreign policy."&#160; This was the ad:</p>
  <p>
    <object height="385" width="480">
      <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/V1DqOwP3Xzc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" />
      <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
      <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />
      <embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/V1DqOwP3Xzc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480"></embed>
    </object>
  </p>
  <p>The Dean campaign was furious that fellow Democrats would run an ad like this that so obviously relied on (and reinforced)&#160;core Rovian, fear-mongering attacks, but more so, they were absolutely incensed that nobody knew who had funded this group, of which the very same Robert&#160;Gibbs, having supposedly just left his position as press secretary with the Kerry campaign, was the spokesman. &#160;And just as the Chamber is doing now, Gibbs' group categorically refused to disclose its funders until the law compelled it to do so -- <u>i.e.</u>, months later, once the Dean campaign was destroyed. &#160;Just read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/16/politics/campaigns/16ATTA.html">this Dec. 16, 2003, <em>New York Times</em> article on the controversy</a> to see how similar this was, and how hypocritical it is for Robert Gibbs of all people to be trumpeting "the fundamental threat to our democracy"&#160;posed by nondisclosure of campaign funding sources:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A new Democratic group that is running advertisements against Howard Dean and <strong>has not yet disclosed its sources of financing</strong> has introduced by far the toughest commercial of the primary election season.</p>
    <p>The spot opens with a Time magazine cover featuring Osama bin Laden as synthesizer music seemingly out of a post-apocalyptic science fiction movie is heard.</p>
    <p>As the camera focuses on Mr. bin Laden's eyes. the following words flash on the screen: "Dangerous World," "Destroy Us," "Dangers Ahead" and "No Experience."</p>
    <p>"Americans want a president who can face the dangers ahead," an announcer intones. "But Howard Dean has no military or foreign policy experience. And Howard Dean just cannot compete with George Bush on foreign policy. It's time for Democrats to think about that and think about it now."</p>
    <p>The advertisement is the latest salvo in what amounts to a "stop Dean" campaign sponsored by the new Democratic group, Americans for Jobs, Health Care and Progressive Values ... <strong>Its spokesman, Robert Gibbs</strong>, recently resigned as the press secretary for Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate.</p>
    <p><strong>The mystery about who is financing the group</strong>, which began its efforts about two weeks ago with an advertisement highlighting past support for Dr. Dean from the National Rifle Association, infuriated Dr. Dean's campaign staff.</p>
    <p><strong>"Whoever is behind this should crawl out from underneath their rock and have the courage to say who they are,"</strong> said Tricia Enright, a spokeswoman for Dr. Dean. "It is hateful, it's cynical, it's exactly the kind of ad that keeps people from voting, that keeps people from getting involved in the process."</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mr. Jones, the group's treasurer, said in response, "We will disclose donors when the law requires."<br /></strong>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As Moody notes, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>'s Lynn Sweet, months later, <a href="http://progressivevalues.com/default.asp?ID=2">did a post-mortem on the collapse of the Dean campaign</a>, and attributed a large part of its demise to "the 18 individuals, two corporations and six unions [Democratic fund-raiser David] Jones persuaded to donate to his Americans for Jobs, Healthcare and Progressive Values fund."&#160; As Sweet noted, this smear-Dean group was created with the <strong>specific purpose</strong> of circumventing campaign finance disclosure laws and <strong>hiding its funders until after the key primaries were held</strong>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jones conceived the anti-Dean operation last year and became the treasurer of what is called a 527 organization, named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code under which these groups operate ...</p>
    <p><strong>Jones' group would operate in initial anonymity because it did not have to file a report disclosing donors with the IRS until Jan. 31 to reflect money collected in 2003. That would be after the Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina contests.</strong> That's a reason most of the stories written about Jones' group -- really a fund since there were only a few people involved, despite the name -- <strong>described it as "shadowy" and "secretive."</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Once the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=800081307&amp;cycle=2004">full funding was finally disclosed</a> -- after the Dean campaign was essentially dead -- it turned out that its largest donor was the <a href="http://www.centerpeace.org/aboutthecenter.htm">"Center for Middle&#160;East Peace,"</a> which bankrolled it for $200,000, along with the&#160;YES&#160;Network ($125,000), the Senate campaign fund of Bob Torricelli&#160;(who had been forced not to seek reelection in disgrace over a campaign finance scandal and is now a lobbyist), and various unions. &#160;All of that was actively concealed from voters while these smear ads ran against Dean; and it stay steadfastly concealed until well after the dirty deed was done.&#160; In other words, in order to destroy Howard Dean's candidacy, the group for which Robert Gibbs was the spokesman did exactly that which the Chamber of Commerce is now doing&#160;(albeit Gibbs' group did it on a much smaller scale), and invoked the same rationale to justify its covert actions.&#160;&#160;</p>
  <p>When Obama chose Gibbs to be his campaign spokesman, Jerome Armstrong -- who had worked on the Dean campaign -- <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2007/02/obama_spokesman_under_scrutiny.html">was outraged</a> precisely because of Gibbs' involvement in this ad.&#160; <a href="http://mydd.com/2007/2/22/robert-gibbs-the-drag-on-obama">He argued</a> (presciently, one could say) that Obama's affection for someone who would be responsible for such a covert, right-wing-replicating, fear-mongering Rovian attack ad against a progressive candidate reflected what type of politician Obama was.</p>
  <p>I'm well aware that most Democrats do not want to hear any of this right now.&#160; Many believe that Democrats have finally found an effective weapon in these Chamber-of-Commerce attacks and are completely uninterested in whether Robert Gibbs (and his former anti-Dean Democratic group)&#160;is guilty of exactly the same cardinal sin as he's accusing the Chamber of committing.&#160; I have no doubt that many believe that there's some sort of partisan duty to overlook such unpleasant facts in order to help the Democrats win.&#160; But this type of totally empty, soul-less, dishonest advocacy is why so many people turn away from the political process and become increasingly apathetic about the outcomes of these two-party wars.&#160; Remember all the "corrosive cynicism" talk from the&#160;Obama campaign?&#160; This is what causes that.&#160; It'd be nice if Robert Gibbs actually believed in the "disclosure" arguments he is making. &#160;I&#160;believe in them. &#160;But he obviously does not believe in them, and would have no trouble -- he had no trouble -- embracing exactly the opposite view if it advanced his political interests. &#160;Look at the corpse of the 2004 Howard Dean campaign if you have doubts about that.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;Think Progress, which originally raised these questions about the Chamber's financing, has <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2010/10/13/chamber-foreign-funded-media/">a new, well-documented update today</a> demonstrating that the&#160;Chamber receives substantial amounts of funds from foreign companies. &#160;The Chamber's response is that it segregates that money and doesn't spend it on elections (and the response to that is that money, being fungible, can't be segregated that way). &#160; I have no objection at all to the questions Think Progress is raising. &#160;I think those are valuable. &#160;As&#160;I said, nondisclosure is a serious threat. &#160;But it's a different issue entirely for the president to be tossing accusations and innuendo at private actors that he doesn't know are true and then demanding that they disclose evidence to disprove it, and it's another thing entirely for Robert Gibbs, who did exactly the same thing on behalf of a Democratic Party advocacy group, to be righteously condemning this behavior.</p>

<title>Kagan's first steps on the Court</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/salon/greenwald/~3/-xqM5j9sz6I/kagan</link>

<description>In two important cases, the newest Justice refuses to join with Ginsburg and Sotomayor</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>Since Elena Kagan was confirmed as a Justice of the Supreme Court, the Court has not yet issued any written rulings on appeals it has accepted for review.&#160; But there are two cases in which Kagan's actions shed some minimal light on how she is approaching her role -- minimal, though still worth noting, particularly in light of how much time and attention was devoted here to her being named as Justice Stevens' replacement.</p>
  <p>On September 23, 41-year-old convicted murderer Teresa Lewis <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/09/23/2010-09-23_teresa_lewis_executed_by_lethal_injection_in_virginia_for_conspiring_in_murders_.html">became the first woman executed in the United States in over five years</a>, when the State of Virginia administered a lethal injection into her arm.&#160;&#160;That occurred only because the&#160;Supreme Court, two days earlier <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/21/AR2010092105773.html">refused, by a 7-2 vote, to stay her execution</a>.&#160; Lewis' lawyers argued that execution was unjust because "she is borderline mentally retarded, with the intellectual ability of about a 13-year-old," because she "had been used by a much smarter conspirator," because she had no prior history of violence and had been a model prisoner, and because&#160;"the two men who fired the shots received life terms."&#160; The two "liberal" justices on the Court -- Ginsburg and Sotomayor -- voted to stay the execution, but <a href="http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2010/09/new-justice-elena-kagans-first-significant-vote-is-against-a-stay-of-teresa-lewiss-execution.html">Elena Kagan voted with</a> Scalia, Thomas, Alito, Roberts, Kennedy, and&#160;Breyer to allow it to proceed. It's impossible to know for certain how Justice Stevens would have voted, but he <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24163745/">did proclaim</a> in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=07-5439#concurrence2">a 2008 decision</a> that he believes the death penalty to be unconstitutional pursuant to the Constitutional bar on "cruel and unusual punishment".</p>
  <p>Yesterday, a similar pattern emerged.&#160; In 2005, two Denver residents were removed from a Bush campaign event solely due to a bumper sticker on their car which read:&#160;&#160;"No More Blood for Oil."&#160;&#160;They sued, alleging their First Amendment rights had been violated, but the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/supreme-court-will-not-yet-hear-case-denver-residents-ejected-bush-event">lower court dismissed the case and the appeals court upheld the dismissal</a>.&#160; The&#160;Supreme Court yesterday refused to review that dismissal, but in a fairly unusual <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-67.pdf">written opinion dissenting from that refusal</a>, Ginsburg -- joined by Sotomayor -- argued that these ejections constituted a clear violation of these citizens' First Amendment rights which the Court should adjudicate.&#160;&#160;She wrote:&#160; "ejecting them for holding discordant views could only have been a reprisal for the expression conveyed by the bumper sticker."&#160; Kagan, again, refused to join those two Justices, siding instead with the conservative bloc and Breyer in voting to refuse the case.</p>
  <p>Caution is warranted against reading too much into Kagan's actions, particularly the latter one.&#160; There are multiple factors which the Court must consider in deciding which cases to take, and a refusal to review a case does not denote agreement with the outcome in the lower court&#160;(of the two decisions, Kagan's refusal to stay the execution is more revealing).&#160; Moreover, in both cases, the outcome would not have changed had Kagan joined Ginsburg and Sotomayor, so it's possible that her joining with the majority was merely some sort of strategic calculation to curry favor early on.&#160;&#160;Still, these two decisions not to join Ginsburg and&#160;Sotomayor are substantive ones, and are at least worth noting as very preliminary signs of Kagan's approach on the Court.</p>
  <p>*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>
  <p>As for the&#160;Obama administration's defense in court of both The&#160;Defense of Marriage Act and&#160;Don't Ask/Don't Tell, as well as the&#160;President's generally anemic approach to gay issues, my views are roughly the same as those expressed <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/10/obamas-excruciating-trap-on-civil-rights.html">here by Andrew Sullivan</a>. &#160;I&#160;intend to write more in the next few days about the contours and limits of the DOJ's duty to defend the constitutionality of duly enacted statutes even where the President purports to disagree with those laws.&#160;</p>

<description>A new study by a University of Chicago professor reveals the obvious about what actually causes terrorism</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>In 2004, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld commissioned a task force to study what causes Terrorism, and <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/10/20/terrorism">it concluded that</a> "Muslims do not 'hate our freedom,' but rather, they hate our policies":&#160; specifically, <strong>"American direct intervention in the Muslim world"</strong> through our "one sided support in favor of Israel"; support for Islamic tyrannies in places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia; and, most of all, "the American occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan"&#160;(the full report is <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/dsb/commun.pdf">here</a>).&#160; Now, a new, comprehensive study from Robert Pape, a University of Chicago political science professor and former Air Force lecturer, substantiates what is (a) already bleedingly obvious and (b) known to the U.S. Government for many years:&#160; namely, that the prime cause of suicide bombings is not Hatred of Our Freedoms or Inherent Violence in Islamic Culture or a Desire for Worldwide Sharia Rule by Caliphate, but rather.&#160; . . . foreign military occupations.&#160; As <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall">summarized by <em>Politico</em>'s Laura Rozen</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Pape. . . will present findings on Capitol Hill Tuesday that argue that <strong>the majority of suicide terrorism around the world since 1980 has had a common cause: military occupation.</strong></p>
    <p>Pape and his team of researchers <a href="http://cpost.uchicago.edu/">draw on data</a> produced by a six-year study of suicide terrorist attacks around the world that was partially funded by the Defense Department's Defense Threat Reduction Agency. They have compiled the terrorism statistics in a publicly available database comprised of some 10,000 records on some 2,200 suicide terrorism attacks, dating back to <strong>the first suicide terrorism attack of modern times</strong> - the 1983 truck bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 241 U.S. Marines.</p>
    <p><strong>"We have lots of evidence now that when you put the foreign military presence in, it triggers suicide terrorism campaigns, ... and that when the foreign forces leave, it takes away almost 100% of the terrorist campaign,"</strong> Pape said in an interview last week on his findings.</p>
    <p>Pape said there has been <strong>a dramatic spike in suicide bombings in Afghanistan since U.S. forces began to expand their presence to the south and east of the country in 2006.</strong> . . . Deaths due to suicide attacks in Afghanistan have gone up by a third in the year since President Obama added another 30,000 U.S. troops. "It is not making it any better," Pape said.</p>
    <p>Pape believes his findings have important implications even for countries where the U.S. does not have a significant direct military presence, but <strong>is perceived by the population to be indirectly occupying.</strong></p>
    <p>For instance, across the border from Afghanistan, suicide terrorism exploded in Pakistan in 2006 as the U.S. put pressure on then Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf "to divert 100,000 Pakistani army troops from their [perceived] main threat [India] to western Pakistan," Pape said.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Imagine that.&#160; Isn't Muslim culture just so bizarre, primitive, and inscrutable?&#160; As strange as it is, they actually seem to dislike it when foreign militaries bomb, invade and occupy their countries, and Western powers interfere in their internal affairs by overthrowing and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/world/25military.html">covertly manipulating their governments</a>, <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1084">imposing sanctions that kill hundreds of thousands of Muslim children</a>, and arming their enemies. &#160;Therefore (of course), the solution to Terrorism is to interfere more in their countries by continuing to occupy, bomb, invade, assassinate, lawlessly imprison and control them, because that's the only way we can Stay Safe.&#160; There are people over there who are angry at us for what we're doing in their world, so we need to do much more of it to eradicate the anger.&#160; That's the core logic of the War on Terror.&#160; How is that <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/08/05/muslims">working</a> <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/143294/approval-gains-nearly-erased-middle-east-north-africa.aspx">out</a>?</p>
  <p>*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;</p>
  <p>Akbar Ahmed, the Chair of Islamic Studies at American University, was on <em>Bloggingheads TV</em> yesterday with&#160;Robert Wright discussing convicted attempted Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/31505?in=12:41&amp;out=16:58">and said this</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Take the case of Faisal Shahzad.&#160; He seems to be, if you put him in a category . . .&#160; he grows up with the reputation of being a party guy, a party boy in the tribal areas [in Pakistan]. . . . He then comes to America and all the pictures are of a modern young man. . . . He changes, but he changes, again, for interesting reasons. The media would have us believe that it's the violence in the&#160;Koran and the religion of Islam.&#160; But hear what he's saying. &#160;He's in fact saying:&#160;&#160;<strong>I am taking revenge for the drone strikes in the tribal areas</strong>. &#160;So he's acting more like a tribesman whose involvement in Pashtun values . . .&#160; one of <strong>the primary features of that is revenge</strong>, rather then saying I'm going to have a jihad or I've been trained by literalists . . . .</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That is confirmed by <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/06/terrorism">mountains of evidence</a> not only about what motivated Shahzad but most anti-American Terrorists as well:&#160;&#160;severe anger over the violence and interference the U.S. brings to their part of the world.&#160; The only caveat I'd add to Professor Ahmed's remarks is that a desire to exact vengeance for foreign killings on your soil is hardly a unique attribute of Pashtun culture. &#160;It's fairly universal. &#160;See, for instance, the furious American response to the one-day attack on 9/11 -- still going strong even after 9 years. &#160;As&#160;Professor Pape documents:&#160;&#160;"when you put the foreign military presence in, it triggers suicide terrorism campaigns . . . and that <strong>when the foreign forces leave, it takes away almost 100% of the terrorist campaign</strong>."&#160; It hardly takes a genius to figure out the most effective way of reducing anti-American Terrorism; the only question is whether that's the actual goal of those in power.&#160;</p>

<description>The U.S. now ranks 49th in the world in life expectancy</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>It's easy to say and easy to document, but quite difficult to really internalize, that the&#160;United States is in the process of imperial collapse. &#160;Every now and then, however, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/08/06/collapse">one encounters certain facts</a> which compellingly and viscerally highlight how real that is.&#160; Here's the latest such fact, from <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.2010.0073v1">a new study in <em>Health Affairs</em> by Columbia Health Policy Professors Peter A. Muennig and Sherry A. Glied</a> (<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2010/10/11/898788/-US-Drops-to-49th-in-the-World-for-Life-Expectancy,-Recent-Study-Shows-Obamas-Health-Plan-Justified">h/t</a>):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In 1950, the United States was fifth among the leading industrialized nations with respect to female life expectancy at birth, surpassed only by Sweden, Norway, Australia, and the Netherlands.&#160; The last available measure of female life expectancy had the United States ranked at forty-sixth in the world.&#160; <strong>As of September 23, 2010, the United States ranked forty-ninth for both male and female life expectancy combined.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Just to underscore the rapidity of the decline, as recently as 1999, the&#160;U.S. was <a href="http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthy_life_table2.html">ranked by the World Health Organization as 24th in life expectancy</a>. &#160;It's now 49th.&#160; There are other similarly potent indicators.&#160; In 2009, the National Center for Health Statistics <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5A30PM20091104">ranked the U.S. in 30th place in global infant mortality rates</a>.&#160; Out of 20 "rich countries" measured by UNICEF, the U.S. <a href="http://www.photius.com/rankings/child_well_being_in_rich_countries_2007.html">ranks 19th in "child well-being."</a>&#160; Out of 33 nations measured by the OECD, <a href="http://www.geographic.org/country_ranks/educational_score_performance_country_ranks_2009_oecd.html">the U.S. ranks 27th for student math literacy and 22nd for student science literacy</a>.&#160; In 2009, the World Economic Forum ranked 133 nations in terms of "soundness" of their banks, and <a href="http://www.photius.com/rankings/soundness_of_banks_2009_weforum.html">the&#160;U.S. was ranked in 108th place</a>, just behind Tanzania and just ahead of Venezuela.&#160;</p>
  <p>There is, however, some good news:&#160; the&#160;U.S. is <a href="http://www.geographic.org/country_ranks/executions_and_death_sentences_country_ranks_2009.html">now in fifth place in total number of executions</a>, behind only China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and comfortably ahead of Yemen and&#160;Sudan, while there are two categories in which the&#160;U.S. has been and remains the <strong>undisputed champion of the world</strong> -- <a href="http://www.allcountries.org/ranks/prison_incarceration_rates_of_countries_2007.html">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.photius.com/rankings/arms_sales_major_suppliers_1999_2006.html">this one</a>.&#160; And, of course, the U.S. is not just objectively the greatest country on the planet, but the greatest country ever to exist in all of human history -- as Dave Roberts <a href="http://twitter.com/drgrist/status/27058262578">put it</a> in response to these life expectancy numbers:&#160; "but we're No. 1 in bestness!" -- so we're every bit as exceptional as ever.</p>

<description>Democrats were once inflamed by Bush policies in these areas yet now are largely indifferent. What explains that?</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below)</strong>
  </p>
  <p><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/113431-white-house-unloads-on-professional-left">Press&#160;Secretary&#160;Robert Gibbs, August 10, 2010</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>During an interview with <em>The Hill</em> in his West Wing office, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs blasted liberal naysayers . . . . "<strong>I hear these people saying he's like George Bush. Those people ought to be drug tested,</strong>" Gibbs said. "I mean, it's crazy."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/10/sotu.01.html">Former&#160;Bush CIA&#160;Director and NSA&#160;Chief Michael Hayden, CNN's <em>State of the&#160;Union</em>, yesterday</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>CANDY&#160;CROWLEY: You sound as though you believe President Obama is doing a good job on the terrorism front.</p>
    <p>HAYDEN: There are some things that I disagree with, and I've disagreed with publicly.</p>
    <p>CROWLEY: Such as?</p>
    <p>HAYDEN: Making the CIA Office of Legal Counsel interrogation memos public, stopping the CIA interrogation program and not really replacing it with any other interrogation program, even to this date.</p>
    <p>But, <strong>by and large,</strong> <strong>there's been a powerful continuity between the 43rd and the 44th president</strong>, and I think that simply reflects the reality that both President Obama and President Bush faced in terms of the threat and the tools that are available to them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>On Terrorism and civil liberties issues, Michael Hayden resides very close to the furthest-right pole even when compared to other Bush/Cheney officials.&#160; He ran the NSA&#160;when Bush's illegal eavesdropping program was implemented&#160;(and was one of its principal defenders), and just last month <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/09/19/david-frakt-stephen-jones-michael-hayden-and-marc-thiessen-discuss-guantanamo-and-enemy-combatants-part-one/">defended Bush's torture program in a debate alongside torture apologist Marc Thiessen</a>.&#160; Indeed, in 2006, then-Senator Obama voted against&#160;Hayden's confirmation as CIA&#160;Director, <a href="http://obamaspeeches.com/073-General-Michael-Hayden-Nomination-Obama-Speech.htm">citing his responsibility for the illegal NSA&#160;program</a>.&#160;&#160;</p>
  <p>Yet here is Hayden <strong>praising</strong> Obama's Terrorism and national security policies on the ground that "there's been a powerful continuity between the 43rd and the 44th president."&#160;&#160;As <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/gwb-and-bho-michael-hayden-says-theyre.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Digby put it in summarizing Hayden's comments</a>:&#160;&#160;"other than the fact that [Obama] blew the cover off the torture regime and refused to publicly endorse waterboarding and putting prisoners in coffins with poisonous bugs crawling all over them, he and Bush are two peas in a pod."&#160; Hayden has lavished Obama with similar "praise" before, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17Terror-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig">telling <em>The&#160;New York Times</em> in January</a>&#160;that "[t]here is a continuum from the Bush administration, particularly as it changed in the second administration as circumstances changed, and the Obama administration," and -- in an article entitled&#160;"Obama uses Bush plan for terror war" -- <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/9/obama-uses-bush-plan-for-terror-war/?page=2">told <em>The Washington Times</em> last month</a> that "<strong>there is more continuity than divergence between the Bush and Obama administrations' approaches to the war on terror</strong>":</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"You've got state secrets, targeted killings, indefinite detention, renditions, the opposition to extending the right of habeas corpus to prisoners at Bagram [in Afghanistan]," Mr. Hayden said, listing the continuities. "And although it is slightly different, Obama has been as aggressive as President Bush in defending prerogatives about who he has to inform in Congress for executive covert action."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above-cited <em>NYT</em> article, written by Peter Baker, also quoted numerous other GOP&#160;and right-wing figures similarly praising Obama on the grounds of continuity:&#160;&#160;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The administration came in determined to undo a lot of the policies of the prior administration," Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the homeland-security committee, told me, "<strong>but in fact is finding that many of those policies were better-thought-out than they realized</strong> -- or that doing away with them is a far more complex task." . . . . James Jay Carafano, a homeland-security expert at the Heritage Foundation, was blunter. <strong>"I don&#8217;t think it's even fair to call it Bush Lite," he said.</strong> "<strong>It's Bush.&#160; It's really, really hard to find a difference that's meaningful and not atmospheric.</strong> You see a lot of straining on things trying to make things look repackaged, but they're really not that different" . . . A senior Obama adviser scoffed at the idea that Bush advisers see continuity . . . . [b]it is true that <strong>much of the Bush security architecture is almost certain to remain part of the national fabric for some time to come, thanks to Obama.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And <em>The&#160;Washington Times</em> article included this:&#160;&#160;"Fran Townsend, a former homeland security adviser to Mr. Bush, said: 'On counterterrorism policy, they found they agree with much of what we did, but that fact is politically inconvenient to acknowledge'."&#160;</p>
  <p>One of the most common and vapid Beltway media clich&#233;s is that "if you're making the Left and&#160;Right angry at you, you must be doing something right."&#160;&#160;But as this right-wing praise demonstrates, in these areas, Obama -- outside of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Jihad-Islam-Sabotage-America/dp/1594033773/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1286795707&amp;sr=8-1">handful of the most crazed extremists</a> who actually believe that he's in confederation with Muslims Terrorists -- hasn't made the Right angry at all. &#160;Quite the opposite.&#160; Bush adherents are as pleased as can be that Obama has largely continued -- even (as <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/05/19/obama">Bush OLC&#160;lawyer Jack Goldsmith argued</a>) made stronger -- the Bush/Cheney architecture on Terrorism and civil liberties.&#160; Contrary to Gibbs' claim that this view is found only among the drug-addled Professional&#160;Left, this is now an undeniable fact recognized by <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0610/ACLU_chief_disgusted_with_Obama.html">people across the political spectrum</a>.&#160; While those who have been highlighting these similarities from the start encountered substantial opposition and even intense anger from Democrats for quite some time, it's now more or less a political consensus that it's true; indeed, the only ones willing to deny it at this point are Obama officials themselves and their rapidly shrinking (though still quite vocal)&#160;band of rabidly loyal followers.&#160;</p>
  <p>So it's not progressive denialism on this issue that's so striking any longer, but rather progressive indifference.&#160; The evidence is now too overwhelming to permit outright denialism, and often, even the hardest-core Obama boosters will pay lip service to the objection that Obama has continued Bush/Cheney policies in these areas (when <em>The&#160;American&#160;Prospect</em>'s&#160;Mark Schmitt appeared in my comment section last week, <a href="http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2010/10/05/schmitt/permalink/a6580fd3f3213a7f76751286ce9d0dc7.html">he acknowledged</a> that&#160;"throughout the Democratic base, there is dissatisfaction at various levels, and much of it is warranted (civil liberties)," while <em>The&#160;New Republic</em>'s Jonathan Chait, in defending Obama from liberal critiques, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/75752/greenwald-switches-methods">wrote</a>:&#160;&#160;"I don't agree with Greenwald's positions on foreign policy and civil liberties, but he does have a valid beef with Obama in these areas").&#160; So not only on the Right, but also in the most mainstream Democratic circles, it has become more or less indisputable that Obama, with a couple of <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/01/22/executiveorders">isolated</a> (and <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/04/17/prosecutions">not unimportant</a>)&#160;exceptions, has enthusiastically embraced the core Bush/Cheney approach to the&#160;War on Terror and civil liberties.</p>
  <p>If Obama had said in 2007 or 2008 that he intended to do this -- if he had run on a Terrorism and civil liberties platform that would make the&#160;Michael Haydens and Fran Townsends of the world gush with praise -- the backlash among Democratic voters would have single-handedly killed his candidacy.&#160; But now that he's actually doing that with the vast power he wields -- that he's been given -- the silence and indifference are deafening.&#160; Why is that?</p>
  <p>*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>
  <p>It would be one thing if War on Terror, civil liberties and executive power abuses were never much of a concern to Democratic voters, that it was just always an ancillary sideshow to more significant political matters.&#160; But the opposite was true.&#160; Throughout the Bush years, anger over the Bush/Cheney approach to civil liberties -- extending far, far beyond the torture issue, encompassing the full list Hayden reeled off -- was one of the driving forces of anti-Bush anger among Democratic voters.&#160; It was a central article of progressive faith that&#160;Bush was tyrannical, was "shredding the Constitution," posed a radical threat to core governmental principles by virtue of these very policies.&#160; So important were these issues that Obama, touting his status as a "constitutional law professor," made reversal of&#160;Bush/Cheney civil liberties and war policies a centerpiece of his campaign.&#160; As Digby wrote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Until the last weeks of the 2008 campaign, it was dominated by the differences in approach to war and foreign policy between Barack Obama and George W. Bush and many of my friends told me that the main reason they preferred Obama over all the other candidates was his bold stand in that arena.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I personally never heard any progressive or even Democrat object that these pervasive criticisms of Bush and Cheney were inaccurate or even hyperbolic or overblown, and that was true even as the most extreme policies (such as Article&#160;II lawbreaking claims and the torture regime)&#160;receded to the background during Bush's second term.&#160; It may be true that civil liberties issues are now a secondary concern for mainstream Democrats, but if that's true, that is a brand new development&#160;(beginning around January 20, 2009).</p>
  <p>Part of what explains this remarkable indifference are just basic political dynamics.&#160; Standard partisan loyalty dictates that one criticize the other party for actions which one overlooks or even defends when done by one's own side.&#160; Particularly now as an election approaches -- where the greatest threat to Democratic power is the so-called&#160;"enthusiasm gap," whereby Obama's 2008 voters are unmotivated to go to the polls -- no&#160;Democrat wants to hear anyone highlighting similarities between Obama and Bush (hence the constant attacks from the White House and their pundit-servants on those who keep voicing these objections).&#160; Many Democrats have become so petrified of Republicans (as intended)&#160;that they believe even legitimate criticisms of Obama should be suppressed lest the&#160;Right be empowered&#160;(just like Republicans once argued that to criticize Bush was to help the Terrorists).&#160; Many&#160;Democrats never believed or cared about their "shredding the Constitution" accusations against Bush, but just opportunistically viewed them as an effective club to beat Republicans over the head for partisan gain.&#160; For some people, the financial and unemployment crisis have drowned out concern about all other issues.&#160; And, as Digby notes, "democracy generally doesn't apply to warmaking" -- <u>i.e.</u>, the military-industrial complex in America always reigns supreme no matter who is elected.</p>
  <p>But I&#160;think there's a deeper root.&#160; The first non-FISA&#160;post I ever wrote after I&#160;began blogging in November, 2005, that received substantial attention was <a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/02/do-bush-followers-have-political.html">this one from early February, 2006</a>, entitled&#160;"Do Bush followers have an ideology?" &#160;It argued that mainstream "conservatism" had ceased being about any specific political ideas and had instead transformed into a cult of personality around&#160;George W. Bush:&#160; "'conservatism' is now a term used to describe personal loyalty to the leader (just as 'liberal' is used to describe disloyalty to that leader), and no longer refers to a set of beliefs about government."&#160;&#160;Having re-read that post recently, it amazes me how much of it applies to our current political situation.</p>
  <p>The principal example there was how conservatives -- who long claimed in general to believe in "limited government power" and in particular spent the 1990s sermonizing about Bill Clinton's civil liberties abuses and violations of the Constitution -- blindly endorsed the most radical expansions of executive power and civil liberties violations as soon as their Party took control of the Oval Office.&#160; Many conservatives took precisely opposite positions on the very same issues (<u>i.e.</u>, they spent the 1990s lamenting the <strong>insufficient constraints</strong> on government eavesdropping from the secret FISA court, then suddenly claimed that the FISA&#160;court was <strong>too</strong> <strong>restrictive</strong> when it turned out&#160;Bush was violating the FISA&#160;law).&#160;&#160;In fact, <a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/03/trip-down-right-wing-memory-lane.html">many of the very same conservatives who led the way in loudly opposing</a> greater government surveillance powers and immunity from investigation during the Clinton years -- such as John Ashcroft -- played a leading role in expanding those same powers during the Bush years far beyond what they had ever been before.&#160;</p>
  <p>The parallel is too obvious to require elaboration:&#160; there is no shortage of Democrats and progressives who hurled all sorts of accusatory rhetoric at Bush and Cheney for -- as Hayden put it -- "state secrets, targeted killings, indefinite detention, renditions, the opposition to extending the right of habeas corpus to prisoners," etc., yet now either turn a blind eye to or actively defend Obama as he does exactly the same thing, and <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/04/obama-doj-worse-than-bush">sometimes</a> <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/04/07/assassinations">worse</a>.&#160; It's certainly true that there has been far more dissent to Obama's actions in these areas from <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/04/08/olbermann/index.html">prominent</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbslm1h8xjI">progressive</a> <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/16/jon-stewart-on-obama.html">commentators</a> than there ever was conservative dissent to Bush, but the vast bulk of Democrats who screamed such bloody murder about these policies during the&#160;Bush years are steadfastly silent or, worse, even supportive now that Obama is doing them.&#160;&#160;I&#160;can't think of anything more absurd than the claim that Democrats currently defending Obama's assassination program would be defending&#160;Bush if he asserted the same unchecked power; there'd be no rhetorical limit on the accusations they'd be hurling if it were Bush and Cheney asserting the power to order the CIA to assassinate American citizens without due process and far from any battlefield.</p>
  <p>Civil liberties and a belief in the need to check government power is something many people care about only when the other party is in control.&#160; They seem to believe that there are two kinds of leaders -- Good ones (their party) and Bad ones (the other party) -- and it's only when the latter wield power that safeguards and checks are necessary.&#160; Good leaders, by definition, are entitled to trust and faith that they will wield power appropriately and for Good ends, thus rendering unnecessary things like accountability, transparency, oversight and even due process. &#160;Of course, the core premise of our government from the start was that political power will be inevitably abused if it is exercised without constraints, that nothing is more irrational or destructive than placing blind faith in political leaders to exercise unchecked power magnanimously.&#160; But the temptation to want to follow Leaders blindly -- to believe in their core Goodness and to thus vest them with unverified trust -- is almost as compelling a part of human nature as the abuse of power when exercised without checks and in the dark.</p>
  <p>That's why self-anointed defenders of the Constitution are instantly transformed into authoritarians and back again every time there is a change of party control:&#160;&#160;many people don't believe in these principles generally, but only when political leaders they dislike are in power.&#160; The problem, though, is that endorsing civil liberties abuses because one's own Party is in power virtually ensures that those abuses will become permanent, available to future leaders from the other Party as well.&#160; That was the argument which fell on deaf ears when made to cheering Bush supporters, and it's barely more effective now.</p>
  <p>*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>
  <p>Just to underscore the "continuity" hailed by Michael Hayden, read the two-page introduction to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Reply_Brief_FINAL_100810.pdf">this Brief filed on Friday by the ACLU and CCR on behalf of Anwar Awlaki</a> <em><strong>[link fixed]</strong></em>; it's extraordinary how similar to the&#160;Bush years are the "justifications" for Obama's assertions of executive authority and claimed power to act free of judicial review.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;As always happens when this topic arises, several Obama supporters are <a href="http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2010/10/11/continuity/permalink/0e1a92000d82339701eee6af4e2fc694.html">claiming</a> that what has changed is that Obama, as President, now has access to unknown secret information which caused him to change his mind about these Terrorism and civil liberties policies. &#160;Leave aside that this is exactly what Bush supporters say about Obama in order to claim vindication (<em>now that he knows the secret Truth, he agrees with us</em>).&#160; Leave aside how creepily authoritarian this mentality is&#160;(<em>if my Leader does something I don't understand, I'll assume that he knows -- and should know -- things that are kept from me which justify what he's doing</em>).&#160; And leave aside that Obama himself has never claimed that this is the case -- he's never said:&#160;&#160;<em>the reason I've change my mind on these issues is because of secret things I've learned --</em> which means that his supporters are inventing for him justifying excuses that not even he has asserted.</p>
  <p>What's most bizarre about this claim is that it amounts to a concession on the part of Obama supporters that Bush and Cheney were right all along, and Obama and other Democrats were wrong all along, about these disputes&#160;(<em>now that Obama knows the secret Truth, he sees Bush and Cheney were right</em>).&#160; But if that's true, then many, many Democrats -- beginning with Barack Obama -- owe Bush and Cheney a heartfelt, sincere apology for all the accusations they voiced over the years:&#160;&#160;accusations which, according to these Obama supporters, they now realize were unwarranted.</p>
  <p>Think about it:&#160;&#160;it would be rather reprehensible for someone like Obama to have spent years hurling the most strident accusations about Bush/Cheney, only for him to realize that they were right all along, but then never publicly acknowledge that, never apologize for or retract the unwarranted accusations he voiced about them.&#160; I&#160;sincerely doubt that this is what explains Obama's reversal on these issues, but Obama supporters who insist that it is are unwittingly attributing to him far more repellent behavior than any Obama critic ever does&#160;(<em>Obama now realizes Bush and Cheney were right and he was wrong but refuses to say so</em>). &#160;And, the fact that they're willing to proclaim that Bush and Cheney were right all along illustrates the lengths to which they'll go to justify all of Obama's actions.</p>

<description>The claims that Terrorist trials in New York would endanger Americans has been exposed as a sham</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below - Update II)</strong>
  </p>
  <p><a href="http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/11/liz-cheney-rails-against-911-trials.php">TPM, November 17, 2009</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Cheney and founder of the Keep America Safe PAC, claimed on Fox News last night that <strong>holding terrorism trials in New York "endangers the United States"</strong> and brings the country "back to a pre-9/11 mentality" . . . .</p>
    <p>She also hinted that <strong>civilian trials would lead to more terrorist attacks.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/nyregion/08nyc.html?_r=1&amp;hp"><em>New York Times</em>, today</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Not one, not two, but three terrorism cases weaved their way simultaneously this week through the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan. . . .</p>
    <p>The courthouse, on Pearl Street off Foley Square, has become "the cineplex of terrorism trials," said Karen J. Greenberg, executive director of the Center on Law and Security at New York University. Her words may have been mildly flippant, but her point could not have been more serious.</p>
    <p>Here we have all these cases unfolding in the civic heart of New York -- people accused or convicted of loathsome deeds involving mass murder, whether planned or carried out. <strong>Not only have the proceedings been handled within the rule of law, but also New Yorkers went about their business without so much as a raised eyebrow.</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>The normality speaks volumes.</strong>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What's most striking is how we collectively never learn lessons.&#160; These are the same people who ran around screaming for two years that we had to attack Iraq or else Saddam would get us all with his mad chemical scientists (<a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2004-09-21/world/iraq.women_1_huda-salih-mahdi-ammash-biological-weapons-evidence-of-iraqi-weapons?_s=PM:WORLD">Dr. Anthrax and&#160;Mrs. Germ</a>)&#160;and nuclear clouds, yet they are still listened to whenever they unleash their newest Scary Villains.&#160; Fear is a potent weapon.</p>
  <p>Speaking of fear-mongering, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/07/barack-obama-terror-threat-claims"><em>The Guardian</em> today has an article</a> with this headline:&#160;&#160;"<strong>Barack Obama accused of exaggerating terror threat for political gain</strong>."&#160;&#160;It quotes numerous Pakistani and&#160;European officials as arguing that the Obama administration's travel advisory this week for Europe -- and its accompanying claim about ongoing plots aimed at Germany and France -- "was politically motivated and not based on credible new information."&#160;&#160;In particular, these sources asserted that the alert "was an attempt to justify a recent escalation in US drone and helicopter attacks inside Pakistan"; was influenced by the imminent elections; and, most of all, that "President Obama was reacting to pressure to demonstrate that his Afghan war strategy and this year's troop surge, which are unpopular with the American public, were necessary."&#160;</p>
  <p>I wasn't particularly impressed with the reporting here:&#160;&#160; Pakistani officials always downplay the Terrorism threat coming from their country and the European officials cited in this article are largely (though not exclusively)&#160;anonymous.&#160; But then I&#160;saw <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101008/ap_on_re_eu/europe_terror_threat_86">this Associated Press article this morning</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>NATO: terror threat in Europe justifies Afghan war</strong>
    </p>
    <p>An al-Qaida-linked plot that triggered this week's U.S. terror alert for Europe underlines the need for the war in Afghanistan, a top NATO commander argued Friday.</p>
    <p>U.S. Adm. James Stavridis, NATO's top commander in Europe, said terrorists using Afghanistan as a base are still trying to target Europe and that this threat justifies a war that has grown unpopular in many places.&#160;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This doesn't at all prove that the terror alert was designed to justify the war by spreading fear, but military officials wasted no time seizing on the alert for that purpose.&#160; That is essentially how America is governed:&#160;&#160;constantly ensure that Americans are petrified of an always-changing, always-expanding cast of Horribles so that they submit to whatever policies -- wars -- are alleged to be devoted to eradicating those threats.&#160; There isn't much attention paid to what happens to a citizenry that is kept in a constant state of increasing fear, but there should be, because the way that degrades a nation's character can't be overstated.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><strong><u>UPDATE</u></strong>:&#160;&#160;Several important items relating to these issues:</p>
  <p><strong>(1)</strong>&#160;Here's an excellent 2-minute video of what is actually happening in New York as Terrorist trials proceed, in contrast to the swamp of fear-mongering to which we have been relentlessly subjected&#160;(h/t&#160;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daphne-eviatar/first-guantanamo-trial-in_b_747321.html">Daphne Eviatar</a>):</p>

  </p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><strong>(2)</strong> As I indicated, the media led the way in War on Terror fear-mongering with articles like the one from CNN&#160;linked above, touting the scary Iraqis Villains "Dr. Germ and Mrs. Anthrax."&#160;&#160;But perhaps the nadir of that fear-mongering was the media's fixation on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Government_most-wanted_Iraqi_playing_cards.jpg">Most Wanted Iraqis deck of playing cards</a>, which <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/07/23/sprj.irq.cards/index.html">they touted endlessly</a>.&#160; Today, <a href="http://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/26765848657">Marc Lynch pointed</a> me to something amazing that I had never seen before:&#160;&#160;watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpck11bp7ZA&amp;feature=youtu.be">this YouTube video from a<strike>n Al&#160;Jazeera</strike> documentary</a> on the media's coverage of the&#160;Iraq&#160;War, beginning at the 4:50 mark, as the U.S. military introduces the playing deck and media figures become instantly desperate to get their own copies and then dutifully march forward to promote them. &#160;It's really quite something.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><strong>(3)</strong>&#160;ProPublica's&#160;Dafna Linzer has <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/dojs-troubled-case-against-uthman">a very worthwhile expos&#233;</a> on one of the detainees the Obama administration is attempting to indefinitely imprison without any charges&#160;(no trial or even military commission). &#160;Using inadvertently disclosed information, she compellingly documents how dubious the case against him is.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><strong>(4)</strong>&#160;<a href="http://chris-floyd.com/articles/1-latest-news/2029-the-altars-of-fear-wrong-turns-on-a-long-dark-road-.html">Chris&#160;Floyd has an important essay</a> on several complex issues, including some discussed here. &#160;Without endorsing all of it, I&#160;highly recommend it.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE&#160;II</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;I linked in the prior update to a clip from <em>Control Room</em>, the 2004 <strike>Al Jazeera</strike> documentary about media coverage and the Iraq War.&#160; Despite how highly regarded it is, I&#160;was actually unaware of this film until Marc Lynch mentioned it to me today, and having now watched all of it, I&#160;can't recommend it highly enough.&#160; The fact that it was produced in only the second year of the war makes it all the more extraordinary. &#160;You can watch the entire film on YouTube, in 9 parts, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgGUG3hzV6g&amp;feature=related">beginning here</a> (each successive part appears in the right-hand column on YouTube).</p>

<description>Those claiming that terrorists don't belong in court -- because some might win -- reject basic American justice</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>As part of the <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/11/13/guantanamo">multi-tiered justice system</a> it created for War on Terror detainees -- whereby some are sent to real courts, some are placed before newly concocted military commissions, and others are just held indefinitely without any charges, all based on the unfettered discretion of the&#160;Government -- the&#160;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/09/AR2009060900401.html">Obama DOJ&#160;last June brought Ahmed Ghailani</a>, accused of bombing two East African embassies in 1998, from Guantanamo to New York to stand trial in federal court.&#160; Ghailani had been detained by the&#160;U.S. without any charges for the past six years, including two years in a secret CIA "black site"&#160;beyond the reach even of international human rights monitors.&#160; At the time they brought him to the U.S. to stand trial, the Obama DOJ believed that the evidence against Ghailani was so overwhelming that a conviction would be close to certain, thus showcasing the efficacy of trying accused Terrorists in federal court.</p>
  <p>But that plan just ran into a roadblock called "the rule of law."&#160;&#160;Judge Lewis Kaplan of the&#160;Southern District of New York <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/CaseDecisionNY.jsp?id=1202472980095&amp;pStyle=decision">yesterday barred</a> the testimony of the Government's key witness -- the individual who says he sold Ghailani the TNT used to blow up the embassies -- because the&#160;Government only learned of that witness as a result of torturing Ghailani.&#160; Kaplan -- who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/nyregion/14ghailani.html">previously rejected Ghailani's motion to have the indictment dismissed</a> on the ground that his right to a speedy trial had been violated and that the torture he suffered compelled dismissal -- relied on centuries worth of clear legal precedent barring the Government from benefiting from information it obtains via coercion and abuse of the defendant.&#160;&#160;In the 1935 case <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=297&amp;invol=278"><em>Brown v. Mississippi</em></a>, the Supreme Court barred confessions made by black defendants that were beaten out of them by Mississippi sheriffs, explaining that the use of coerced statements has been "the curse of all countries"&#160;(emphasis added):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It was the chief iniquity, the crowning infamy of the Star Chamber, and the Inquisition, and other similar institutions. The Constitution recognized the evils that lay behind these practices and prohibited them in this country. . . . The duty of maintaining constitutional rights of a person on trial for his life rises above mere rules of procedure, and <strong>wherever the court is clearly satisfied that such violations exist, it will refuse to sanction such violations and will apply the corrective.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That, and countless other judicial precedents, is what Judge Kaplan applied to bar the Government from benefiting from its abusive treatment of Ghailani, explaining that the&#160;rule of law, if it is to be meaningful, must apply to everyone, even to the Scariest Terrorists&#160;(<em><strong>click on image to enlarge</strong></em>):</p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MnYI3_FRbbQ/TK3QsffWHgI/AAAAAAAACsE/tRS9DG5soVA/s1600/kaplan.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}">
      <img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5525301780639260162" name="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5525301780639260162" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MnYI3_FRbbQ/TK3QsffWHgI/AAAAAAAACsE/tRS9DG5soVA/s400/kaplan.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 48px;" />
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>The Obama DOJ, as always, was eager to avoid any public airing of what was actually done to detainees, and thus did not contest, but rather conceded for purposes of the Motion, that Ghailani was abused during his detention at the&#160;CIA black site, arguing instead that (a)&#160;learning of the witness' name was too attenuated to the torture to warrant barring the witness, and (b) they had grounds for discovering the witness independent of the abuse. &#160;Kaplan rejected both claims, and gave the Government several days to re-work its trial strategy (or to appeal)&#160;now that its key witness is banned.</p>
  <p>All of this, needless to say, is being depicted from predictable corners as proof that Terrorists do not belong in real courts.&#160; <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/248886/embassy-bombing-trial-jeopardy-andrew-c-mccarthy"><em>National Review</em>'s Andy McCarthy complained</a> that "civilian due-process standards are crippling the government&#8217;s case" and that "we are intentionally tying our hands behind our backs and running an unnecessarily high risk of acquittal in a case involving a war criminal."&#160; Wisconsin Law Professor <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/10/things-are-going-badly-for-obamas.html">Ann Althouse thundered</a>:&#160;&#160;"I want to hear President Obama explain his decision and the judge's decision to the American people." &#160;<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/1010/Ruling_could_be_setback_for_civilian_terror_trials.html"><em>Politico</em> announced</a> that Judge Kaplan's ruling "could deal a major setback to those who favor civilian criminal trials for Guantanamo Bay prisoners, including those suspected in the September 11 attacks."&#160;&#160;McCarthy lamented:&#160;&#160;"the slam dunk has become a horse race, one the government could actually lose."</p>
  <p>Consider the rationale driving these who object to real trials:&#160;&#160;it's vital that the Government be able to use information that it obtained by torturing people. &#160; It's equally vital that the&#160;Government be absolutely assured that it will obtain a conviction against anyone it accuses of being a Terrorist.&#160; Because this is a "war," we can waive our usual rules of justice.&#160; Any proceeding which imposes limits on the Government's ability to profit from its torture, or which introduces any uncertainty as to the verdict, is proven to be both inappropriate and dangerous.&#160; We can and should simply imprison whomever we want in the&#160;War on&#160;Terror without the need for any charges, but if we do charge and try them, it should only be in newly invented tribunals (<u>i.e.</u>, military commissions) where traditional due process is severely reduced and the rules are designed to <strong>ensure</strong> a guilty verdict, even it means allowing torture-obtained evidence.&#160;</p>
  <p>People who think this way, by definition, simply do not believe in the rule of law. &#160;A system that <strong>guarantees</strong> guilty verdicts is not one that operates under the rule of law. &#160;Those are called&#160;"show trials" -- at least they used to be when other countries did that.&#160; And the demand that torture-obtained evidence be admissible not only removes one from adherence to the rule of law, but from the civilized world as well.&#160; The whole point of a "justice system" is that there are rules that are well-established and which apply equally to everyone. &#160;Although the requirement that the Government adhere to those rules will inevitably mean that some very, very bad people are acquitted -- including mass murderers, child rapists, and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/june97/mcveigh_6-2.html">even Terrorists</a> -- that's the price we've always been willing to pay to live under what we call "the rule of law" and a "justice system." &#160;Those pointing to Judge Kaplan's ruling as proof that Terrorists should not be tried in a real court -- all because he applied centuries-old legal principles to the Government -- believe in none of that, by definition.</p>
  <p>Then again, this whole spectacle of bringing Ghaliani to New York is quite like a show trial anyway.&#160; The&#160;Obama DOJ&#160;only deigned to allow Ghaliani a trial because it was convinced it was guaranteed of a conviction; had it not been so convinced, they would have simply sent him to a military commission or held him without charges of any kind, as they're doing to multiple other detainees against whom they don't believe they can win in a real court.&#160; Beyond that, the administration has <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/07/08/obama">already asserted what it calls "<strong>post-acquittal detention power</strong>"</a>:&#160; namely, the power to continue imprisoning anyone as an "enemy combatant" under the law of war even if they charge that person with crimes and lose in court.&#160; &#160;Indeed, Judge Kaplan -- seemingly eager to assure the public that he wasn't endangering them with his ruling -- cited this claimed power in his decision:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_MnYI3_FRbbQ/TK3ZwhpYyUI/AAAAAAAACsM/2Urofh1n1f0/s1600/kaplan1.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}">
      <img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5525311745542375746" name="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5525311745542375746" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_MnYI3_FRbbQ/TK3ZwhpYyUI/AAAAAAAACsM/2Urofh1n1f0/s400/kaplan1.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 63px;" />
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>So even if Ghaliani is acquitted, it's almost certain that we'll just keep imprisoning him -- effectively forever -- without any charges at all.&#160; The Obama administration deserves some credit for bringing him to trial in the first place, but it's very hard to know what the supposed benefit is -- or how it vindicates the rule of law -- if it is a classic "show trial":&#160; if he's convicted, we'll all celebrate how Justice has been vindicated, but if he's acquitted on all charges, we'll just keep him in a cage forever anyway, under the theory the the&#160;President possesses "post-acquittal detention power."</p>

<description>A Syrian man's efforts to be compensated for the horrible War on Terror abuse he suffered will undoubtedly fail</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/06/AR2010100606458.html"><em>The Washington Post</em> today</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A Syrian man released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay last year sued the U.S. military Wednesday, saying that he was the victim of a "Kafkaesque nightmare" in which he was tortured by al-Qaeda after being accused of being U.S. spy, liberated, then tortured by the Americans, who held him for seven more years by mistake.</p>
    <p>Abdul Rahim Abdul Razak al-Janko, 32, who has been resettled outside the United States, filed suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, the court that ordered his release in June 2009. At the time, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon concluded that the U.S. government's case for holding Janko "defies common sense."</p>
    <p>Janko was tortured by al-Qaeda and imprisoned by the Taliban for 18 months on suspicion of being a spy for the United States or Israel. Leon found no evidence that the Syrian was loyal to either group.</p>
    <p>Janko "is the victim of a decade-long Kafkaesque nightmare from which he is just awakening," the suit says.</p>
    <p>Janko says that he was urinated on by his American captors, slapped, threatened with loss of fingernails, and exposed to sleep deprivation, extreme cold and stress positions. . . .</p>
    <p>Spokesmen for the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment late Wednesday on the case, which had not been entered into the court's electronic database.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Fortunately, the&#160;Obama DOJ -- <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/7701491/Al-Ginco-v-Obama">which fought unsuccessfully to keep Janko imprisoned at Guantanamo</a> -- has been so consistent in its standards that one need not wait to hear from them to know how they will respond.&#160; It's the same way they've responded in similar cases:&#160;&#160;<a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/09/torture-case-tossed/">whatever was done to this person is a State Secret that no court can review</a>; <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2009/12/08/MN061AVC89.DTL">those who are responsible for the abuse do and should enjoy full legal immunity</a>; and, besides, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/04/why-obama-doesnt-care-about-yoo/16632/">we should all be Looking Forward, Not Backward at "unnecessary battles"</a> like this one.&#160; I&#160;don't know why Janko can't just accept that what was done to him is a big secret that cannot possibly be compensated without jeopardizing American National Security and, more important, realize that he should just get on with his life and the Glorious Future and stop asking us all to Look Backward to what was done to him (all the way back to the ancient past of 2004 and 2007 and 2009). &#160;That's the only just thing to do.&#160;</p>
  <p>Note this similarity as well:&#160;&#160;Janko was, <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/7701491/Al-Ginco-v-Obama">as the Court found</a>, first "not only imprisoned, but tortured by Al Qaeda into making a false 'confession'" that he was an American spy, and then, lawlessly imprisoned for 18 months by the&#160;Taliban as a spy, only thereafter to be abducted and lawlessly detained by the U.S. for seven years, where he was also tortured.&#160; All that, despite no evidence whatsoever that he was loyal to Al Qaeda and plenty of evidence that he was not (namely, the fact that they detained and tortured him as an American spy).&#160; Cases such as this one really underscore how wise it is to vest the&#160;President with the power to decide -- on his own, with no review or oversight -- who is and is not a Terrorist worthy of death.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;The always-thorough Andy Worthington last June wrote <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2009/06/24/why-did-it-take-so-long-to-order-the-release-from-guantanamo-of-an-al-qaeda-torture-victim/">an excellent narrative on the heinous plight of Janko, which is well worth reading</a> (h/t <a href="http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2010/10/07/justice/permalink/760782197e6457d8ec33b1710ae0f14b.html">harpie</a>). &#160;That the&#160;Obama DOJ's tactics virtually ensure he will receive no accountability or justice is horrifying, though par for the course by now.</p>

<title>Times Square bomber:  Cause and effect in the War on Terror</title>

<media:description type="plain">This June 29, 2010 photo taken from video and provided by the FBI shows an FBI-staged explosion in Osceola Mills, Pa., that prosecutors say replicates the power of the car bomb Faisal Shahzad tried to detonate in Times Square on May 1.</media:description>
</media:content>
<description>Yet again, an attempted terrorist claims his actions were in response to U.S. violence in the Muslim world</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>Faisal Shahzad was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101005/ap_on_re_us/us_times_square_car_bomb">sentenced by a federal judge</a> to life in prison yesterday for his attempted bombing of Times Square, a crime for which he previously pleaded guilty.&#160;&#160;Aside from proving yet again how uniquely effective our real judicial system is (as opposed to military commissions or lawless detention) in convicting and punishing Terrorists (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/opinion/06wed3.html?ref=opinion">this <em>NYT</em> Editorial</a> on that issue this morning), this episode sheds substantial light on what I <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/04/terrorism/index.html">wrote about on Monday</a>:&#160; namely, how our actions in the Muslim world -- ostensibly undertaken to combat Terrorism -- do more than anything else to spur Terrorism and ensure its permanent continuation.</p>
  <p>Ever since Shahzad was apprehended, the media storyline has been one of <em>faux</em> bafflement:&#160;&#160;<em>why would a naturalized Pakistani-American citizen with an M.B.A. and such a nice, middle-class life in the U.S. possibly turn into such a vicious Terrorist&#160;Monster?</em>&#160; But from the start, the evidence answering that question has been both clear and overwhelming.&#160; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/nyregion/16suspect.html?ref=faisal_shahzad"><em>The New York Times</em> examined</a> a decade's worth of emails and other private communications as Shahzad became radicalized against the&#160;U.S., in which he railed with increasing fury against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, drone attacks in&#160;Pakistan, Israeli violence against Palestinians and Muslims generally, Guantanamo and torture, and asked: "Can you tell me a way to save the oppressed? And <strong>a way to fight back when rockets are fired at us and Muslim blood flows</strong>?"&#160; When he pleaded guilty in June, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/21/AR2010062102468.html?hpid=moreheadlines">this is what he told</a> the baffled and angry Judge about why he did what he did:&#160;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>If the United States does not get out of Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries controlled by Muslims, he said, "we will be attacking U.S.," adding that Americans "only care about their people, but they don't care about the people elsewhere in the world when they die" . . . .</strong>
    </p>
    <p>As soon as he was taken into custody May 3 at John F. Kennedy International Airport, onboard a flight to Dubai, the Pakistani-born Shahzad told agents that he was motivated by opposition to U.S. policy in the Muslim world, officials said.</p>
    <p>"<strong>One of the first things he said was, 'How would you feel if people attacked the United States? You are attacking a sovereign Pakistan',"</strong> said one law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the interrogation reports are not public.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And then yesterday, at his sentencing, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/times-square-bomber-faisal-shahzad-sentenced-life/story?id=11802740&amp;page=2">this is what he said</a> when asked if he still wanted to plead guilty:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Yes," said Shahzad, and then said he wanted to plead guilty and 100 times more," because he wanted the U.S. to know <strong>it will continue to suffer attacks if it does not leave Iraq and Afghanistan and stop drone strikes in Pakistan.</strong></p>
    <p>Calm, but clearly angry, and standing the whole time . . . . Shahzad said the judge needed to understand his role. "I consider myself a Muslim soldier," he said. When [Judge] Cedarbaum asked whether he considered the people in Times Square to be innocent, he said they had elected the U.S. government.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Even children?" said Cedarbaum.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>"When the drones [in Pakistan] hit, they don't see children," answered Shahzad. He then said, "I am part of the answer to the U.S. killing the Muslim people."</strong>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Shahzad is far from unusual. &#160;In fact, virtually every perpetrator of an attempted anti-U.S. Terrorist attack -- beginning with 9/11 and even before -- has cited similar rationale for why they are willing and eager, even at the cost of their own lives, to attack the U.S.:&#160; because the&#160;U.S., through its own actions and its enabling of Israel, constantly brings violence, invasions, bombings, occupations, <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1084">child-killing sanctions</a>, overthrows, foreign control, and widespread death to their part of the world, and has been doing so for many decades.&#160; Obviously, religious fanaticism plays a role in causing people to be willing to give up their own lives, but so constant and consistent is this claimed rationale from Terrorists -- <em>we're doing this in retaliation for U.S. actions in the Muslim world</em> -- that it should no longer be questioned or doubted what principally motivates these attacks.</p>
  <p>It's one thing for Americans to argue that we have the right to engage in these actions, that we are justified in doing them, or that we somehow are doing Good Things for&#160;Muslims with our bombs and drones even though these primitive ingrates don't realize it.&#160; But it's another thing entirely to act shocked, surprised or confused when our endless (and still-escalating) stream of bombings, invasions, occupations, and other means of control in their part of the world end up provoking a desire to retaliate and return the favor.&#160; It's not just expected that our actions will produce these reactions, but <strong>inevitable<em>.&#160;</em></strong> It's the most basic part of human nature there is. &#160;<a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2010/10/05/very-complicated-logic/">John Cole put it this way yesterday</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When you bomb people and kill their family, friends, and neighbors, burn down their homes and burn down their businesses and kill their livestock, spewing unexploded ordnance and munitions in fields where they work and their children play, it pisses them off. Many of them even get pissed off enough to fight back against the people they think are responsible for the bombing. They probably even form lifelong grudges when they find their mother and children in thousands of bloody pieces in their former homes.</p>
    <p>Again, this is not rocket surgery. If they were not sympathetic to the Taliban and Al Qaeda before, after you bomb the shit out of them, they will be. &#160;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As always, the issue is not <strong>justification</strong> -- it is inherently unjust to deliberately target civilians with violence -- but <strong>causation</strong>.&#160; Look at what happened to Americans and what we did in response to a single<strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">,</span> one-day attack</strong> on 9/11. &#160;Imagine the fury and craving for vengeance and violence that would be unleashed in the U.S. if we were being invaded, occupied, bombed, tortured, disappeared, and indefinitely, lawlessly detained by a foreign Muslim power on U.S. soil <strong>for a full decade or more</strong>.&#160;</p>
  <p>The very idea that we're going to spend an entire decade dropping a constant stream of bombs and other munitions on and in multiple Muslim countries and otherwise interfere in their governments -- and then expect that nobody will try to attack us back -- evinces such a child-like sense of imperial entitlement that it's hard to put into words.&#160; And yet this is exactly the mindset that pervades our discussions of Terrorism:&#160;&#160;<em>why would anyone possibly want to do something as heinous and senseless as placing a bomb in the United&#160;States?</em>&#160;&#160;<em>I just don't understand it.&#160; What kind of an irrational fanatic and monster would even think of something like that?</em> &#160;Of course, the people who say such things rarely apply the same language to our own political leaders who are engaging in far, far more widespread violence over there and <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/09/20/100853/graham-us-must-consider-military.html">still crave</a> more of it.</p>
  <p>This is the cause-and-effect that, in general, is so rarely discussed or acknowledged.&#160; Yesterday, <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/10/yes-1.html">Andrew Sullivan responded</a> to some of the points I&#160;raised about Obama's assassination program, and in doing so, again explained why he favors assassinations as part of a global war against&#160;"a theocratic military organization of horrifying methods":</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]here are groups and individuals out there trying to kill as many Westerners, and fellow Muslims, as they can, and to do so with no qualms and with as much damage as possible. This is not a chimera. <strong>Attacks have continued every year since 9/11 and before.</strong> The perpetrators of 9/11 remain at large. New bases in Yemen and Somalia and Iraq and Pakistan and Afghanistan exist.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I wonder why "attacks have continued every year since 9/11" and why there are "new bases" springing up all over the world?&#160;&#160;Might anything we've been doing "since 9/11" -- or before -- have caused that?&#160; Indeed, what this mentality calls for -- an always-escalating global war aimed at Muslims -- is perfectly designed (even if unintentionally)&#160;to ensure that Terrorist attacks on the&#160;U.S. not only continue but escalate forever.&#160; In <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2010/10/should-we-kill-anwar-al-awlaki.html">an excellent response to Sullivan's defense of assassinations, <em>The New Yorker</em>'s Amy&#160;Davidson</a> makes clear the breadth and depth of the destruction which this mentality spawns:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sullivan thinks that there is a sprawling international battlefield in the war on terror on which al-Awlaki can be said to be a soldier. But we are not at war with Yemen -- not yet. Or are we just talking about a metaphorical, or figurative, battlefield? What are this battlefield&#8217;s boundaries -- does it have any? If our fight against Al Qaeda is truly global, can the President order an American citizen assassinated without due process in London, or, for that matter, in Brooklyn?&#160;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It's true that we're not legally at war <strong>with</strong> Yemen, but we most certainly are <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/yemen-images-missile-and-cluster-munitions-point-us-role-fatal-attack-2010-06-04">at war <strong>in</strong> Yemen</a>, just as we are in Afghanistan, and in Pakistan, and in Iraq, and in Somalia, while we threaten Iran and arm and otherwise enable Israel in its acts of wars over the past several years in Lebanon, Gaza, and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/02/11/080211fa_fact_hersh">Syria</a>. &#160;What do we think and expect the people in that part of the world to do in the face of this always-escalating global aggression and violence?&#160;&#160;What would we do -- what <strong>did</strong> we do -- in the face of it when a mere sliver of it is brought to our soil?&#160; And consider the implications of those who think we must bomb all locations where Terrorists are found in order to "disrupt" their training:&#160;&#160;a never-ending expansion of our War on Terror to all new places in the&#160;Muslim world. &#160;Does anyone rational believe that this will do anything other than exacerbate the threat which&#160;Americans face?</p>
  <p>In&#160;fact, consider what would likely happen if we did succeed in assassinating the Wikipedia-condemned, Evil Al Qaeda Monster, Anwar Awlaki.&#160;&#160;I've devoted little attention to this question because I don't believe the&#160;President has the authority to order due-process-free CIA&#160;assassinations of American citizens even if good outcomes can be achieved.&#160; But it's hard to imagine a good outcome from this action.</p>
  <p>Whatever else Awlaki is, he's a highly popular Islamic cleric to whom huge numbers of Muslims listen.&#160; If the&#160;U.S. were to kill him in a drone attack as he sleeps, it would eliminate Awlaki, but it is painfully obvious that: (a)&#160;someone would quickly take his place (does Awalki radicalize Muslim youth, or do they listen to him because they're already radicalized?); (b)&#160;his anti-American sermons (preserved forever on the Internet)&#160;would almost certainly be even <strong>more influential and popular</strong> if he were "martyred" by the&#160;U.S.; and, most important, (c) killing him would inspire large numbers of his devout, youthful adherents to want to attack Americans in retaliation.&#160; Indeed, Awlaki himself was long considered a moderate imam in the&#160;U.S., but -- <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/0602carnegie-awlaki.pdf">as <em>The New York Times</em>' Scott Shane explained at a recent, superb panel discussion on Awlaki</a> -- he was radicalized by perceived U.S. persecution of Muslims in the wake of 9/11. &#160;Killing Muslims we don't like from the sky can eliminate those specific targets, but -- <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/10/20/terrorism">as even the DOD&#160;has recognized since 2004</a> -- those actions are precisely what spawn more and more Terrorism. &#160;It's certainly true that even a total cessation of U.S. violence in the Muslim world would not eliminate all Terrorists, but our behavior clearly, on balance, spawns more Terrorism and more threats to Americans' security.</p>
  <p>Our national foreign policy seems boiled down to this premise:&#160;&#160;we must and will continue to bomb, invade and control Muslim countries until they stop wanting to attack and bomb us or, at least, are unable to continue to do so.&#160; Obviously, though, if we continue to engage in that behavior, that day will never come, given that this behavior is precisely what fuels most of it.&#160; Just ask them and they'll be more than happy to explain it, as Faisal Shahzad has spent months attempting to do.</p>

<description>Tom Daschle confirms, then denies, what has long been clear:  Obama secretly negotiated it away early on</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>As&#160;I've noted before, the column of mine which produced the greatest level of hate mail and anger in the last year -- both in terms of intensity and quantity -- was <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/08/19/obama/index.html">this one from August, 2009</a>, when I compiled the evidence strongly suggesting that the&#160;White&#160;House, despite Obama's multiple statements to the contrary, had secretly bargained away the public option with corporate interests early in the negotiation process and therefore did not intend to push for its inclusion in the final bill.&#160; That produced so much anger because it contradicted the central Democratic orthodoxy at the time that Obama -- as he claimed in public -- was trying as hard as he could to have a public option in the health care bill, but . . .&#160; gosh darn it, he was unfortunately stymied by his inability to get 60 votes for it, despite his best efforts (the fact that the health care bill ultimately passed via reconciliation, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/03/12/democrats">whereby the public option would have needed only 50 votes</a>, was a separate issue).</p>
  <p>Illustrative of the backlash was <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/75752/greenwald-switches-methods">this post from <em>The New Republic</em>'s Jonathan Chait</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I don't agree with Greenwald's positions on foreign policy and civil liberties, but he does have a valid beef with Obama in these areas. <strong>But when he insists that Obama secretly opposed the public option</strong> and has never wanted more stimulus, in the face of overwhelming evidence that the administration <strong>pushed the Senate as far left as it would go</strong> on those bills, <strong>he is revealing himself as a fanatic</strong>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At the time Chait wrote that, there was already ample evidence that the&#160;White House had, in fact, secretly negotiated away the public option early on in the process, including <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/miles-mogulescu/ny-times-reporter-confirm_b_500999.html">confirmation from a <em>New York Times</em> reporter of the existence of such a deal</a>, as well the fact that <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/72375-lieberman-expresses-regret-to-colleagues-over-healthcare-tension-">Russ Feingold said as clearly as he could</a> that the reason there was no public option in the final bill was because the White House never pushed for it, because the final bill -- without the public option -- was the "<strong>legislation that the president wanted</strong> <em><strong>in the first place</strong></em>."</p>
  <p>But now, definitive evidence has emerged that this is exactly what happened:&#160;&#160;a new book by Tom Daschle.&#160; As <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/10/05/daschle-interview/">Igor Volsky of ThinkProgress expertly documents</a> -- both by citing to Daschle's book and by interviewing him -- the&#160;White House had negotiated away the public option very early in the process (July, 2009), even though&#160;Obama and the&#160;administration spent months after that assuring their supporters that they were doing everything they could do have a public option in the bill:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In his book, Daschle reveals that after the Senate Finance Committee and the White House convinced hospitals to to accept $155 billion in payment reductions over ten years on July 8, the hospitals and Democrats operated under two "working assumptions." "One was that the Senate would aim for health coverage of at least 94 percent of Americans," Daschle writes. "<strong>The other was that it would contain no public health plan</strong>," which would have reimbursed hospitals at a lower rate than private insurers.</p>
    <p>I asked Daschle if the White House had taken the option off the table in July 2009 and if all future efforts to resuscitate the provision were destined to fail:</p>
    <p><strong>DASCHLE</strong>: I don&#8217;t think it was taken off the table completely. <strong>It was taken off the table as a result of the understanding that people had with the hospital association, with the insurance (AHIP), and others. I mean I think that part of the whole effort was based on a premise.</strong> That premise was, you had to have the stakeholders in the room and at the table. Lessons learned in past efforts is that without the stakeholders' active support rather than active opposition, it&#8217;s almost impossible to get this job done. <strong>They wanted to keep those stakeholders in the room and this was the price some thought they had to pay.</strong> Now, it's debatable about whether all of these assertions and promises are accurate, but that was the calculation. I think there is probably a good deal of truth to it. You look at past efforts and the doctors and the hospitals, and the insurance companies all opposed health care reform. This time, in various degrees of enthusiasm, they supported it. And if I had to point out some of the key differences between then and now, it would be the most important examples of the difference.</p>
    <p>[VOLSKY]:&#160;&#160;Despite being "taken off the table" as a result of the "understanding," the White House continued to publicly deny claims that it was backing away from the provision even as it tried to focus on other aspects of the bill. "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/16/white-houses-mixed-messag_n_260733.html">Nothing has changed</a>," said Linda Douglass, then communications director for the White House Office of Health Reform in August of 2009 and many times thereafter. "The president has always said that what is essential is that health insurance reform must lower costs, ensure that there are affordable options for all Americans and it must increase choice and competition in the health insurance market. He believes the public option is the best way to achieve those goals."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What Daschle said here -- in his interview with Volsky and, apparently, in his new book -- is crystal clear, and is consistent with what has long been clear: &#160;despite its stream of public statements to the contrary, the&#160;Obama White House made no efforts to have a public option in the bill because their secret, early agreement with "stakeholders" was that no public option (and thus no real mechanism of competition with private industry) would be created.&#160;</p>
  <p>One can reasonably argue that entering into secret, backroom deals to please industry interests was a "pragmatic" thing to do, notwithstanding how often Obama railed against exactly such transactions during his campaign&#160;(remember the <em>I'll-put-all-health-care-negotiations-on-C-SPAN</em> pledge?). &#160;One can also argue that the public option would never have gotten 60 votes even if Obama and the White House had pushed for it.&#160;&#160;But one cannot argue that the White House did push for it, or even that they wanted it, since it was part of their deal with industry and its lobbyists from the start that it would not be in the final bill.</p>
  <p>Quite amusingly and predictably, this ThinkProgress post was up for a very short period of time when&#160;Daschle suddenly emailed them a "clarification," which said this (see the&#160;Update):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"In describing some of the challenges to passage of the public option in the health reform bill, I did not mean to suggest in any way that the President was not committed to it. The President fought for the public option just as he did for affordable health care for all Americans. <strong>The public option was dropped only when it was no longer viable in Congress, not as a result of any deal cut by the White House.</strong> While I was disappointed that the public option was not included in the final legislation, the Affordable Care Act remains a tremendous achievement for the President and the nation."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But that directly contradicts what Daschle told Volsky (the&#160;Public Option&#160;"<strong>was taken off the table as a result of the understanding that people had with the hospital association, with the insurance (AHIP), and others</strong>"), as well as what, apparently, is in his own book.&#160; As soon as the&#160;ThinkProgress item was up, a controversy begun to erupt, for obvious reasons.&#160; We'll never know what prompted Daschle to issue this "clarification" -- Daschle is, let's recall, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/02/01/daschle">exactly what Matt Taibbi so memorably described him as being</a> -- but it's painfully clear that the actual truth about what happened with the public option finally emerged quite clearly, albeit for a few short moments.&#160; Is Daschle going to retract his not-yet-released book, too?</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>

<description>In the face of all evidence, American Prospect's executive editor claims it's confined to "a couple of blogs"</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below - Update II)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>I understand that some people who hold themselves out as "journalists" are going to be Party loyalists and apparatchiks whose overarching goal is to dutifully serve Party officials.&#160; Still, just for the sake of credibility and efficacy if nothing else, one would think that the smarter ones would at least bind themselves to some minimal notions of reality.&#160; <em>The American Prospect</em>'s Executive&#160;Editor Mark Schmitt apparently has no concerns of that sort. &#160;In a <em>Bloggingheads</em> discussion yesterday with <em>National Review</em>'s Ramesh Ponnuru, who asked him about the prospect of a 2012 primary challenge, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/31366?in=39:45&amp;out=41:51">Schmitt said this</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I&#160;think there's a lot of attention -- y'know, there's too much attention on the dissatisfied Democratic base, um, y'know, represented, by y'know, really by a couple of blogs [chuckling], frankly.&#160;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It'd be great news for the Democratic Party and the Obama White House if Schmitt's claim were true.&#160; The&#160;White House itself certainly doesn't appear to share Schmitt's views, given how repeatedly and petulantly Obama officials have complained about this dissatisfaction:&#160; a very strange thing to be concerned with if it were confined to just "a couple of blogs."&#160; Nor do pollsters appear to view the world through the sunny, pro-Democratic mentality expressed by Schmitt, as it is a virtual consensus among them that the <a href="http://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2010/09/quantifying-enthusiasm-gap.html">greatest threat to Democratic power</a> is the so-called "enthusiasm gap."</p>
  <p>But judge for yourself:&#160;&#160;just examine the recent evidence on this question to see if Schmitt's claim -- "the dissatisfied Democratic base [is] represented really by a couple of blogs" -- bears any relationship whatsoever to reality:</p>

    <p>Labor leaders, alarmed at a possible Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, promise to devote a record amount of money and manpower to helping Democrats stave off disaster. But political analysts, and union leaders themselves, say that their efforts may not be enough because <strong>union members, like other important parts of the Democratic base, are not feeling particularly enthusiastic about the party</strong> -- a reality that, in turn, further dampens the Democrats' chances of holding onto their Congressional majorities. . . .</p>
    <p>Patricia Elizondo, president of the 2,000-member Milwaukee local of the International Association of Machinists, fears just that.</p>
    <p>"People have been unemployed for two years, and they're unhappy that the health care bill was not as good as they expected," she said. "Two years ago, I had many members going door-to-door to campaign. <strong>Now they're saying, 'Why should I?&#160; We supported that candidate, but he didn't follow through'."</strong></p>

    <p>[Obama] energized a coalition -- made up of blacks, women, Latinos, young voters and large numbers of suburbanites -- that some believed would keep Democrats in power for years to come.</p>
    <p>A scant 20 months later, <strong>the Obama coalition is frayed and frazzled.</strong></p>
    <p>A majority of those who voted for Obama still approve of the job he is doing. But that number is eroding.</p>

    <p>Some who threw their lot in with Obama expressed a sense of being let down by the man who promised change and pledged to transform the country.&#160; Some attributed that to their own lofty expectations and, perhaps, their naivete.&#160; Others pointed to what they saw as his lack of focus on the still-faltering economy.</p>
    <p>And some suggested they were simply hoodwinked by a smooth-talking politician.</p>

    <p>Democratic donors like George Soros, the b&#234;te noire of the right, and his fellow billionaire Peter B. Lewis, who each gave more than $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in the 2004 election, appear to be holding back so far.</p>
    <p>"Mr. Soros believes that he can be most effective by <strong>funding groups that promote progressive policy outcomes</strong> in areas such as health care, the environment and foreign policy," said an adviser, Michael Vachon. "So he has opted to fund those activities."</p>
    <p>The absence of these Democratic megadonors is contributing to a huge disparity in spending between pro-Republican and pro-Democratic groups. . . .</p>
    <p>The attention of Mr. Lewis, chairman of Progressive Insurance, also appears to be elsewhere this year. Jennifer Frutchy, who advises Mr. Lewis on his philanthropy, said he was focused at the moment on "<strong>building progressive infrastructure</strong> and marijuana reform."</p>
    <p>"That's just where his head is right now," Ms. Frutchy said [GG:&#160; <em>note the distinction they are drawing between (a)&#160;donating to Democrats and (b) advancing progressive causes]</em>. . . .</p>
    <p>For donors, there is certainly an element of fatigue from giving cycle after cycle, as well as an economic squeeze brought on by the recession, the operatives said. But some more ideological donors are also <strong>upset that the Obama administration has not been more aggressive in pushing a liberal agenda.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Hispanic voters' support for Democratic candidates waned in August and September. As a result, <strong>Hispanics in September favored Democrats by a 13-point margin (51% to 38%), compared with 32-point margins in June and July</strong>."</p>
    <p>That's the price Democrats are paying for failing to address key immigration issues. . . . Obama and the Democrats look weak, disengaged, and aloof on the number one issue facing a key constituency in the Democratic electoral coalition. It hasn't just been bad policy, but disastrous electoral strategy as well.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It's true that <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/143354/Obama-Approval-Averages-September.aspx">the same Gallup poll</a> shows Obama's approval ratings at 79% among Democrats and 75% among liberals.&#160; But "approval ratings" -- where one has a dichotomized choice&#160;(yes/no) -- say nothing about enthusiasm levels or willingness to take action in support of someone. &#160;More important, the fact that 25% of liberals and 20% of Democrats withhold approval for Obama is obviously significant, by itself proving that dissatisfaction extends far, far beyond a&#160;"couple of blogs." &#160;Add to that all of this other empirical evidence, and it's undeniably clear that dissatisfaction is widespread in the&#160;Party -- pervading most of its core constituencies -- and is a serious threat to continued Democratic rule.</p>
  <p>It's fine if someone wants to be a cheerleader, clapping loudly in order to rally the troops.&#160; Every Party has and needs those types of people (though it's strange (though not unusual) that a person who wants to do that would call himself a "journalist"; generally one finds that trait in political operatives and spokespeople). &#160;But as the Bush propagandists of the last decade learned the hard way -- as they continuously insisted that the&#160;Iraq War was Going Great even as everyone could see how false that was -- being an effective propagandist requires at least a <strong>pretense</strong> of what <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43107.html">Michael Kinsely today hails</a> as "intellectual honesty":</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Intellectual honesty is more demanding: It means being truthful about what's going on inside your own head.</p>
    <p>To start, you shouldn't say anything that you don't believe is true. But that's just to start. Intellectual honesty means that you have a basis for your belief, that you have tested your belief against other beliefs on the same subject, that <strong>you have no blinding bias or, at least, have put bias aside as best you can.</strong></p>
    <p>"Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander": <strong>Your views on, say, the constitutional limits of presidential war powers should not turn on which party controls the presidency. . . .</strong></p>
    <p>Intellectual dishonesty, meanwhile, is so built into the Washington culture that you have to force yourself to notice it. It even has a more familiar and less pejorative name: "spin." <strong>Spin is not just another word for lies. A better definition might be "indifference to the truth."</strong> The really great spin artists, like Karl Rove and James Carville, are celebrated as masters of their craft.&#160; Journalists crowd around them, longing to get spun.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The claim that dissatisfaction among Democrats is confined to a "couple of blogs"&#160;might advance Schmitt's political objectives.&#160; Given the human craving to make perceptions correspond with desires, it likely makes him feel good to believe that it's true.&#160; But it's so plainly false that it's hard to believe that anyone could say it with a straight face, let alone believe that it will help anything -- their&#160;Party or themselves -- to claim it.&#160; As a general proposition, papering over serious problems -- pretending they do not exist -- is never constructive, and that's certainly true when it comes to a Party's political failures.&#160; Worst of all, making this claim obscures a very important truth that ought to be promoted and amplified, one which the establishment media&#160;("move to the Right!") will do its best to deny after November:&#160;&#160;Democrats do themselves no favors when they ignore the wishes, values and agenda of their "base":&#160; <u>i.e.</u><em>,</em> those who are most responsible for their being in power.&#160;&#160;Quite the opposite is true.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><strong><u>UPDATE</u></strong>:&#160; Schmitt appears in the comment section and raises several points over the course of multiple comments, including a claim that I&#160;omitted the context of his remarks, which was whether someone would mount a primary challenge against Obama in 2012. &#160;I'm not sure how he can claim that I&#160;omitted this since -- aside from linking to the full video of his discussion&#160; -- I&#160;introduced Schmitt's comments this way:&#160;&#160;"In a Bloggingheads discussion yesterday with <em>National Review</em>'s Ramesh Ponnuru, <strong>who asked him about the prospect of a 2012 primary challenge</strong>, Schmitt said this. . . ."&#160;&#160;I&#160;don't know how it's possible to have made the context any clearer than that.&#160; I also think it changes nothing, but everyone interested is encouraged to listen to his full remarks and read his responses in the comment section.</p>
  <p><a href="http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2010/10/05/schmitt/permalink/a6580fd3f3213a7f76751286ce9d0dc7.html">Schmitt also now says</a> that he recognizes -- and intended to convey -- that dissatisfaction with Obama is widespread in the&#160;Party, far beyond a "couple of blogs,"&#160;and writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>[T]hroughout the Democratic base, there is dissatisfaction at various levels, and much of it is warranted (civil liberties).</strong> Some of it is warranted if you think that Obama had another clear option (e.g., if he'd pushed harder for public option, it would have succeeded), and not if you don't -- it's an empirical argument about what's actually possible.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That, to me, seems quite at odds with what he actually said, but I'll take him at his word that this is what he believes and it certainly narrows (though does not eliminate)&#160;the scope of the disagreement.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE&#160;II</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;Just to review a bit of history, Schmitt was one of the very first influential liberal commentators to hail the Greatness of Barack Obama and his Transformative Power, as reflected by <a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_theory_of_change_primary">this 2007 "Theory of Change"&#160;piece in <em>The&#160;American Prospect</em></a>, which argued:&#160;&#160;"Hope and bipartisanship are not things that Obama naively believes are present and possible -- they are a tactic, a method of subverting and breaking the unified conservative power structure."&#160; In January, 2010, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=theory_of_change_at_year_one">he wrote</a>:&#160;&#160;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>for those of us who were steeped in the netroots sensibility on the left, as both of us were, it's kind of astonishing that <strong>the fulfillment of the four- or five-year project of progressive renascence would be a figure like Obama and his distinctive language of reconciliation</strong>. . . . Obama's "theory of change" I suggested in my December 2007 essay succeeded on the most basic level -- it attracted a breadth of coalition and changed the electoral map in a way that neither "John Edwards" nor Clinton would have been able to do.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At least during the Obama presidency (as opposed to the campaign), most of that turned out not to have happened. &#160;It most certainly did not usher in an era of bipartisanship, or bring about a "progressive renascence," or subvert conservative power -- quite the opposite.&#160; Schmitt himself, in 2010, somewhat acknowledged that:&#160;&#160;"But as prediction for what would happen in the first year of an Obama administration, I have to admit, it doesn't hold up as well."&#160;&#160;As one knowledgeable reader put it in an email to me today about Schmitt's 2007 piece:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This was the single most important Obama piece written in the liberal Village. I have no idea if Obama believed it or scoffed at it as a bunch of na&#239;ve bozos thinking he really gave a damn. But whatever, it was a terrible misreading of politics in this era.&#160; And it excused all the hippie punching and Republican fellating for months -- the old 27 dimensional chess crapola.</p>

<description>Trying to solve terrorism with more bombings is like trying to cure lung cancer by smoking more</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The&#160;U.S. war in (against)&#160;Pakistan continues to escalate, as <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/front-page/three-killed-in-attack-on-nato-tankers-400">Pakistanis attacked&#160;NATO&#160;tankers</a> carrying fuel through their country to soldiers in Afghanistan last night, killing three people, an attack that was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8040726/Pakistan-Taliban-claims-responsibility-for-Nato-convoy-attack.html">in retaliation</a> for <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Afghanistan/us-drone-strikes-climb-pakistan-border/story?id=11750242">vastly increased U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan this month</a>, which were ordered in <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20101004/ts_nm/us_security_europe">alleged response to reports of increased Terrorist threats aimed at Europe</a>, which, in turn, were in retaliation for the escalating wars in Afghanistan and&#160;Pakistan&#160;(as evidenced by the large numbers of individuals of Afghan descent involved in these plots).&#160;&#160;Jim White -- <a href="http://seminal.firedoglake.com/diary/74916">in a post this morning</a> entitled&#160;"Stuck in Feedback Loop: Drone Strikes Provoke Terrorists Who Provoke More Drone Strikes" -- documents exactly the process at play here:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The situation in Pakistan appears to have reached a point where a positive feedback loop prompts continued escalation on both sides. The US sees drone attacks as its primary weapon and has stepped up such attacks in the belief that they will create more security for military actions in Afghanistan and disrupt planning of terrorist attacks on the West.&#160; Instead, the attacks appear to enrage the surviving targets, recruit more to their ranks and lead to more attacks.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What a surprise:&#160;&#160;bombing Muslims more and more causes more and more Muslims to want to bomb the countries responsible.&#160; That, of course, has long been the perverse "logic" driving the War on Terror.&#160; The very idea that we're going to reduce Terrorism by more intensively bombing more Muslim countries is one of the most patently absurd, self-contradicting premises that exists. &#160;It's exactly like announcing that the cure for lung cancer is to quadruple the number of cigarettes one smokes each day.&#160;&#160;But that's been the core premise (at least the stated one)&#160;of our foreign policy for the last decade:&#160;&#160;we're going to stop Terrorism by doing more and more of exactly the things that cause it (and see <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/10/robots_war">this very good <em>Economist</em> article</a> on the ease with which drones allow a nation's leaders to pretend to its citizenry that they are not really at war -- as we're doing with Pakistan).</p>
  <p>Speaking of counter-productive U.S. actions in Pakistan, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093006891.html">this <em>Washington Post</em> article from Friday</a> discusses the possibility that a coup could be engineered in that country to overthrow the current Government and replace it with one that is friendlier to U.S. interests:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>U.S. officials pointed to recent signs that Pakistan's powerful army and opposition parties are positioning themselves to install a new civilian government to replace President Asif Ali Zardari and his prime minister in the coming months. . . . U.S. officials indicated that the administration has begun to contemplate the effects of a change, engineered through Zardari's resignation as head of his political party, the dissolution of the current coalition government, or a call for new elections under the Pakistani constitution, rather than any overt action by the military. Some suggested that a new, constitutionally-approved government that was more competent and popular, and had strong military backing, <strong>might be better positioned to support U.S. policies.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The article does not say that the&#160;U.S. is actively involved in those efforts, but it's very difficult to imagine American military and intelligence officials simply sitting passively by as a coup is underway in a country (like Pakistan)&#160;where we are so invested, just keeping their fingers crossed that it results in a new government "better positioned to support U.S. policies."&#160;&#160;Whatever else is true, it's very easy to imagine how such a coup -- resulting in a more U.S.-friendly government -- will be perceived in that country and around the Muslim world. &#160;That perception is unlikely to help reduce the threat of Terrorism.</p>

<title>Sullivan's defense of presidential assassinations</title>

<description>The justifications for Obama's hit list reveal what is missing most from American political thought</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>During the Bush-era torture debates, I was never able to get past my initial incredulity that we were even having a "debate" over whether the&#160;President has the authority to <strong>torture people</strong>.&#160; <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/10/answers-for-glenn-greenwald.html">Andrew Sullivan has responded</a> to some of <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/09/29/sullivan">the questions I posed</a> about his defense of Obama's assassination program, and I&#160;realize now that throughout this whole assassination debate, specific legal and factual issues aside, my overarching reaction is quite similar:&#160;&#160;I actually can't believe that there is even a "debate" over whether an American President -- without a shred of due process or oversight -- has the power to compile hit lists of American citizens whom he orders the&#160;CIA&#160;to kill far away from any battlefield.&#160; The notion that the President has such an unconstrained, unchecked power is such a blatant distortion of everything our political system is supposed to be -- such a pure embodiment of the very definition of tyrannical power -- that, no matter how many times&#160;I see it, it's still hard for me to believe there are people willing to expressly defend it.</p>
  <p>Moreover, it's almost impossible to ignore how similar are the rhetoric and rationale between (a) Bush supporters who justified presidential torture and (b) Obama supporters who now justify <strong>presidential due-process-free assassinations</strong>. &#160;Please read&#160;<a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2010/10/01/assassination/">Daniel Larison's argument about that, responding to Sullivan's post</a>.&#160;&#160;He's exactly right.&#160;</p>
  <p>The central rhetorical premise of Bush defenders was that if they just scream "Terrorist!!' and&#160;"we're at war!!!!" enough times, and loudly enough, then it would make basic precepts of due process, Constitutional safeguards and the rule of law disappear.&#160; If they demonized their targets enough (this is a <em><strong>really bad</strong></em> <strong>Terrorist who wants to kill Americans, with nukes if he can!!</strong>) -- or manipulatively invoked 9/11 enough times (note Andrew's prominent display of a smoldering WTC photo strategically placed at the top of his argument) -- then it would mean that anything goes, that no compliance with law is or should be required to do anything to them&#160;(a claim that always led to the unanswerable question:&#160; if it's really so obvious that this is a really bad Terrorist, then why not prove it in court?).&#160;</p>
  <p>And if you just toss enough insult-strawmen at those who insist upon basic rights even when "we're at war!!," then you can marginalize them to the point of invisibility (I wasn't around in 2003 and thus never got to be accused by Andrew of being a Far-Leftist-pacifist-unwilling-to-fight-the-menace-of-Islamic-Evil, so I guess it's nice that I'm making up for that now.&#160; I always thought a "pacifist" was one who opposes the use of force under all circumstances, even self-defense [a view to which I&#160;do <strong>not</strong> subscribe]; I&#160;never knew that&#160;one becomes a "pacifist" by believing that the&#160;President lacks the power to order his own citizens assassinated far from any battlefield without due process). &#160;Just read Andrew's post to see how reliant he is on these same tactics to justify Obama's program:&#160;&#160;quite ironic, given how often he has had these same tactics used against him during his steadfast, eloquent opposition to torture.</p>
  <p>In any event,&#160;I was going to address a few of Andrew's specific claims, because some of them are factually inaccurate (I don't believe that's intentional, but merely the by-product of the fact that Andrew doesn't write about the legal issues raised here very often).&#160;&#160;And I&#160;still will do that below, but before I do:&#160;&#160;as I was writing this, I&#160;received an email from a Kenyan lawyer, <a href="http://www.mladvocates.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=37">David Majanja</a>, that so perfectly illustrates how far America has fallen on these issues of basic liberty as compared to much of the rest of the world, and what authoritarian extremists many Americans have become on these questions, that I want to feature it first.&#160;</p>
  <p>As Majanja noted in his email to me, Kenya faces a <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=925">massive threat from terrorism</a>.&#160; Radicals bombed the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998 and attacked an Israeli-owned tourist resort and Israeli airliner in Mombasa in 2002, and that country has repeatedly been under Terrorist threats for the last decade.&#160; Nonetheless, consider <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/02/assassinations/Habeas_Corpus_Ruling.pdf">this court decision</a> that was just issued in Nairobi on Thursday.&#160; A Kenyan Muslim, Mohamed&#160;Sulemein, was detained in&#160;August -- without any charges or due process -- by Kenyan anti-terrorism agents&#160;(the ATPU), accused of having participated in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10593771">the horrific June World Cup bombings in Kampala, Uganda</a>, which killed 74 innocent people.&#160;&#160;He had his passport seized and was told he would be sent to Uganda without any opportunity to contest the accusations against him. &#160;His wife filed a habeas corpus petition in a Kenyan court, demanding that "he be treated in accordance with the laws and&#160;Constitution of Kenya," which, among other things, guarantees the right to be charged with a crime within 24 hours of arrest and not to be shipped outside the country without a hearing.&#160;</p>
  <p>The Kenyan Court agreed, and ruled that the due-process-free extradition of this accused Terrorist to Uganda was illegal and unconstitutional. &#160;Just read what the court said to see what's so profoundly absent from American political thought; this, to me, is the crux of all of these debates, including the one over presidential assassinations:</p>

  <p>The person whose rights were denied there is accused of Terrorist acts every bit as reprehensible and dangerous as the accusations aimed at Anwar Awlaki.&#160; His rights were denied to a far less extreme degree than what is being done to&#160;Awlaki (rendition to Uganda for trial v. being targeted for due-process-free assassination).&#160; Kenya faces a Terrorism threat at least equal to what the&#160;U.S. faces, and several times has suffered atrocious attacks on its soil.&#160;&#160;But they are nonetheless able to recognize that citizens "are not exempted from the ordinary protections of law"&#160;by virtue of being a Terrorism suspect, and that "the preservation of liberties [even for Terrorist suspects] is <strong>the only way</strong> to reinforce this country's commitment to the rule of law and human rights."&#160;&#160;If only that recognition were equally widespread in the&#160;U.S., which still holds itself out as "the leader of the free world."</p>
  <p>*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>
  <p>As for Andrew's specific claims:&#160;&#160;I realize that it's not possible for him to address every point I made and that he made a good faith effort to answer the questions I&#160;asked, but I&#160;was still disappointed to see him ignore these questions, because these are the same ones I&#160;could never get Bush supporters to answer either: &#160;<strong>(1)</strong> would you also be comfortable with having a GOP&#160;President -- such as Sarah Palin -- vested with the unchecked power to order American citizens killed far from any battlefield, with no due process and no obligation to prove the accusations?; <strong>(2)</strong> Andrew says that the&#160;President does not have the right to kill&#160;American citizens on U.S. soil, but what rationale can justify that limitation once you endorse the view that the&#160;President can order citizens killed anywhere they are found via the mere accusation of Terrorism?; <strong>(3)</strong> shouldn't the long and disturbing record of serious error and/or abuse on the part of both the Bush and&#160;Obama administrations -- <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/07/08/97211/federal-judge-order-release-of.html">whereby numerous individuals, a <strong>majority</strong>, have been <strong>falsely</strong> accused of Terrorism</a> -- lead a rational person to refuse to vest faith in the President's ability to decide who is a Terrorist without due process or oversight?; and <strong>(4)</strong>&#160;how could Bush's oversight-free detention or eavesdropping of citizens be so dangerous, whereas Obama's oversight-free killing of them isn't?</p>
  <p>Then there are several factually inaccurate assertions.&#160; Andrew claims that Obama has "expanded judicial review of this kind of military action," which is the only reason Awlaki's case is in court.&#160; The claim that these assertions of power are being reviewed by courts due to Obama's beneficence is absolutely false; they're in court because Obama -- like Bush -- has <strong>been sued</strong> for acting illegally and unconstitutionally, and Obama -- like Bush -- has asserted that no courts can review his conduct due to secrecy and standing (see <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/04/expert_consensus_obama_aping_bush_on_state_secrets.php">this article from the Obama-friendly TPM site</a> -- headlined:&#160;&#160;"<strong>Expert consensus:&#160;&#160;Obama mimics Bush on state secrets</strong>" -- to see how identical the conduct is).&#160; Obama's argument is the exact opposite of what Andrew claims:&#160;&#160;it's that courts have <strong>no right and no power&#160;</strong>to review his decisions about which citizens are assassinated.&#160;</p>
  <p>Then Andrew cites <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=317&amp;invol=1"><em>Ex parte Quirin</em> [1942]</a>&#160; to claim that "it is utterly uncontroversial that the military can kill a US citizen abroad if he is waging a treasonous war against the United States,"&#160;but even that case -- long considered quite radical and a favorite of the&#160;Yoo/Addington camp -- came only after the defendants were <strong>charged in a military commission</strong> of being saboteurs, and the Supreme Court merely held that military commissions constitute sufficient due process for the offenses with which they were charged.&#160;&#160;Here's what the Court actually said (emphasis added):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The President, as President and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, by Order of July 2, 1942, <strong>appointed a Military Commission and directed it to try petitioners for offenses against the law of war and the Articles of War</strong> . . . On July 3, 1942, the Judge Advocate General's Department of the Army prepared and lodged with the Commission <strong>the following charges</strong> against petitioners, supported by specifications: . . . The Commission met on July 8, 1942, and <strong>proceeded with the trial</strong>, which continued in progress while the causes were pending in this Court . . .As announced in our per curiam opinion we have resolved those questions by our conclusion that the Commission has jurisdiction to try the charge preferred against petitioners. . . .</p>
    <p>We are concerned <strong>only with the question whether it is within the constitutional power of the national government to place petitioners upon trial before a military commission for the offenses with which they are charged</strong>. . . . Lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military forces. Unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful. . . . We hold <strong>only that those particular acts constitute an offense against the law of war which the Constitution authorizes to be tried by military commission.</strong>&#160;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Aside from the fact that these defendants were <strong>caught in the act of engaging in hostilities</strong> -- not sleeping or driving in a car with their parents, as Awlaki might be doing when he's killed -- this case doesn't remotely justify assassinating citizens <strong>without any due process</strong>, and I really hope Andrew would retract the suggestion that it does. &#160;The <strong>whole point</strong> of <em>Ex parte Quirin</em> -- as anyone can see -- is that these defendants were <strong>given due process</strong>:&#160; a military tribunal which the court found constitutionally adequate under the circumstances.&#160; That's the <strong>opposite</strong> of Obama's due-process-free assassinations.</p>
  <p>Then Andrew says this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I agree that the Obama administration's decision to shut down inspection of the evidence behind the decision to regard Awlaki as someone waging an active war against the US under "state secrets" is a step way too far. <strong>I think the president has a duty to explain in court why he believes this person must be treated as an active enemy at war with the US, and therefore treated as all such enemies in wartime as someone to be killed.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But this is the crux of the whole dispute.&#160; Once one concedes this, what disagreement is left with critics of Obama's conduct?&#160; What Andrew says Obama has a "duty" to do -- "explain in court why he believes this person must be treated as an active enemy at war with the US" -- is precisely that which Obama is steadfastly refusing to do. &#160;Rather than indict or charge Awlaki, or even respond to his lawsuit with evidence of his guilt, he's simply asserting the right to kill him without any oversight.&#160; Indeed, before Awlaki's father filed suit, that's <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2009/12/24/imam-linked-ft-hood-rampage-believed-al-qaeda-killed-airstrike/">exactly what Obama has been trying to do</a>:&#160;&#160;kill this American citizen without any due process whatsoever (along those lines, Andrew's announcement that he's "sick of the left treating Obama as if he has done nothing to change the dictatorial, illegal and indecent policies of his predecessor" is very odd, given that Andrew himself -- in a <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/09/what-tyranny-is-this.html">post from several weeks ago which he entitled "The&#160;Untamed&#160;Prince"</a> -- called for the prosecution of Barack Obama as a war criminal, and wrote:&#160;&#160;"<strong>Obama as executive quickly co-opted the kind of blanket secrecy and protection of the national security apparatus from the rule of law that plagued us in the Bush-Cheney administration</strong>"; those are Andrew's words, not the words of "the left").</p>
  <p>But the most telling part of his response is where&#160;Andrew replies to my question about how he knows that Awlaki is actually an "Al&#160;Qaeda Terrorist" who deserves to die:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is much public information about Awlaki, and I urge readers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki">go to Wiki</a> and examine the public record and sources in detail to make their own minds up. . . . But seriously, is Glenn honestly saying that a man who has committed treason, has had multiple direct contacts with al Qaeda, including the 9/11 mass-murderers, has been directly connected with inciting American citizens to kill others in terror attacks is not, self-evidently, an al Qaeda terrorist who poses a direct and imminent threat to innocent human beings, motivated by a poisonous religious ideology that was responsible for the murder of 3,000 people on 9/11?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is what we're reduced to in America:&#160; <em>trial by Wikipedia</em>. &#160;Apparently, as long as there are enough links on your Wikipedia page to other accused Terrorists, then the&#160;President can wave his imperial wand and impose the death penalty on you. &#160;Aside from the fact that most of what is on "Wiki"&#160;comes from unproven government accusations, and aside from the fact that it's almost all rank guilt by association&#160;(Andrew:&#160; "Witnesses report he was a spiritual adviser to and <strong>met with two 9/11 mass-murderers, Nawaf Al-Hazmi and Khalid Almihdhar</strong>"), this claim raises the painfully obvious question:&#160; <strong>if the evidence is so clear and overwhelming that Awlaki is a Terrorist who deserves the death penalty, then why are Obama -- and his supporters -- so afraid to indict him and prove these claims in court?</strong>&#160; That was always the quandary posed by Bush's assertion that he could eavesdrop or detain with no judicial oversight, but was doing so only on obvious Terrorists:&#160;&#160;if it's so clear that they're Terrorists, why won't you go to court and convince a court that they're Terrorists?</p>
  <p>As for Andrew's claim that Awlaki "has committed treason,"&#160;I'll say this:&#160;&#160;he may or may not have. &#160;But we have this document called "the Constitution,"&#160;and it makes as clear as can be that no President has the power to simply decree that someone is guilty of that crime.&#160; Right in <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#A3Sec3">Article&#160;III, Section 3</a>, it explicitly makes clear what must be done if one is to be punished as a traitor:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. <strong>No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless</strong> on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What possible justification exists for ignoring that Constitutional provision?&#160; Even if we are at war, there is, manifestly, <strong><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/02/04/assassinations">no "war exception" to the Constitution</a>.</strong> &#160;"War"&#160;is not, and never has been, a cognizable excuse for disregarding Constitutional guarantees -- at least not in a republic that still adheres to the rule of law.</p>
  <p>In general, <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am5">the U.S. Constitution prohibits</a> the deprivation of "life or liberty&#160;. . . without due process of law."&#160;&#160;But because of how serious a crime Treason is, the Constitution imposes <strong>heightened requirements</strong> on proving it <strong>in court</strong>.&#160; It's not something that is presidentially declared by anonymous press leaks or reading a Wikipedia page.&#160; If the rule of law means anything, it's that explicit Constitutional protections like this one don't get to be swatted away by yelling "War!!!" or "Terrorist!" or by putting emotionally powerful pictures of 9/11 on your blog.&#160; As the&#160;Kenyan judge put it:&#160;"the preservation of liberties [even for Terrorist suspects] is <strong>the only way to reinforce this country's commitment to the rule of law</strong>."&#160; If you're willing to vest the&#160;President with the power to order your fellow citizens murdered as a Traitor without a shred of due process, then, by definition, you simply do not believe in these core principles.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;In response to numerous reader emails, Andrew posts a couple more brief thoughts on all of this <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/10/answers-for-glenn-greenwald-yes-we-are-at-war-ctd.html">here</a>.</p>

<description>The silence of the American government and media in the face of this report is illustrative and telling</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below - Update II - Update III)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Last week, the Office of the&#160;U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights released <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.21_en.pdf">a comprehensive report</a> detailing its findings regarding the&#160;May, 2010, Israeli attack on the six-ship flotilla attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Israel-blockaded Gaza.&#160;&#160;The report has been largely ignored in the American media despite the fact (or, more accurately:&#160;&#160;<strong>because</strong>) it found&#160;that much of the Israeli force used "was unnecessary, disproportionate, excessive and inappropriate and resulted in the wholly avoidable killing and maiming of a large number of civilian passengers"; that "at least six of the killings can be characterized as <strong>extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions</strong>"; and that Israel violated numerous international human rights conventions, including the Fourth Geneva Conventions&#160;(see p. 38, para. 172).&#160;</p>
  <p>Even more striking in terms of U.S. media and government silence on this report is the fact that one of the victims of the worst Israeli violations was a 19-year-old American citizen.&#160; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/29/un-factfinding-mission-sa_n_743873.html">As Gareth Porter documents in an excellent article at <em>The&#160;Huffington&#160;Post</em></a>, the report "shows conclusively, for the first time, that US citizen Furkan Dogan and five Turkish citizens were murdered execution-style by Israeli commandos."&#160;&#160;In particular:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The report reveals that Dogan, the 19-year-old US citizen of Turkish descent, was filming with a small video camera on the top deck of the Mavi Marmara when he was shot twice in the head, once in the back and in the left leg and foot and that he was shot in the face at point blank range while lying on the ground.</p>
    <p>The report says Dogan had apparently been "lying on the deck in a conscious or semi-conscious, state for some time" before being shot in his face.</p>
    <p>The forensic evidence that establishes that fact is "tattooing around the wound in his face," indicating that the shot was "delivered at point blank range." The report describes the forensic evidence as showing that "the trajectory of the wound, from bottom to top, together with a vital abrasion to the left shoulder that could be consistent with the bullet exit point, is compatible with the shot being received while he was lying on the ground on his back."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Needless to say, the Israeli Government -- as it <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/21/opinion/la-oe-0422-terris-20100421-10">virtually always does</a> when confronted with well-documented, official findings of its severe human rights violations -- <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-presses-un-to-stall-debate-on-biased-gaza-flotilla-report-1.315463">attacked the source</a>, accusing the report of being&#160;"biased and distorted."&#160;&#160;The U.N. investigators interviewed 112 witnesses and consulted with numerous forensic and medical experts, while Israel refused to speak with its investigators&#160;(though&#160;Israeli officials are cooperating with a separate group investigating the attack).&#160; There's no reason to take the findings of this report as Gospel:&#160;&#160; like everything, it's subject to reasonable dispute, but it's clearly well-documented, consistent with documentary evidence and overwhelming witness tesitmony, and is entitled to be taken seriously.</p>
  <p>To this day, I'm still amazed by how the American media and U.S. Government responded to this incident, given the fact that it was <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/06/04/israel">painfully obvious from the start</a> that the Israelis' conduct was the behavior of a guilty party.&#160; The&#160;Israelis immediately <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/world/middleeast/02flotilla.html?hp">seized all documentary evidence from the passengers</a> showing what actually happened, blocked all media access to witnesses by <a href="http://en.rsf.org/israel-at-least-60-journalists-were-02-06-2010,37646.html">detaining everyone on board (including journalists)&#160;for days</a>, and then quickly released its own highly edited video -- spliced to begin well into the middle of the Israeli attack -- that was dutifully and unquestioningly shown over and over by the U.S. media to make it appear that the flotilla passengers were the first to become violent.&#160; That was a lie from the start, and it was an obvious lie.&#160;</p>
  <p>In no other situation would a party to a conflict who steals all of the evidence, withholds it from the world, and then selectively releases its own blatantly distorted, edited version of a fraction of the evidence be trusted. &#160;The opposite is true:&#160;&#160;that party would immediately be assumed to be guilty precisely because of that very behavior of obfuscation; that behavior is the behavior of a guilty party.&#160;&#160;But with Israel, the opposite happens (at least in the&#160;U.S.). &#160;The&#160;IDF video was shown over and over to propagnadize Americans into believing that the passengers were the first to engage in aggression, even though the video -- and the Israelis' withholding of all the rest of the evidence -- begged the glaringly <strong>obvious</strong> question:&#160;&#160;what happened <strong>before</strong> the commandos descended onto the ship?&#160; Based on smuggled video and forensic evidence, this new report documents what countless flotilla witnesses tried to tell the world once they were finally released:&#160;&#160;"<strong>live ammunition was used from the helicopter onto the top deck</strong> <em><strong>prior to</strong></em> <strong>the descent of the soldiers</strong>" (p. 26; para. 114 -- emphasis added).</p>
  <p>Last Wednesday night, I&#160;spoke at&#160;Brooklyn Law School on this event, and with me on the panel were Columbia University Professor Rashid Khalidi and Iranian-American lawyer Fatima Mohammadi, who was on the Mavi Marmara.&#160; I'm trying very hard to obtain the video of that event because Mohammadi's narration of what happened -- all documented by smuggled video from passengers' cell phones -- leaves little doubt as to who the guilty aggressors were here.&#160;&#160;I would really like as many people as possible to hear what she has to say and view the video evidence and make their own assessments as to her credibility and persuasiveness. &#160;Suffice to say, there is no doubt that the Israelis used force against the passengers long before the commandos descended onto the ship -- which is precisely why Israel prevented the world from seeing any evidence showing what happened <strong>before</strong> the events in the IDF&#160;video, and why the&#160;U.N.&#160;Report so conclusively found Israel at fault. &#160;I'd be willing to venture that a tiny percentage of the American public, whose perceptions were shaped by American media coverage, have any clue that this is the case.</p>
  <p>The fact that a 19-year-old&#160;American citizen was one of the dead -- among those whom the report concluded was "summarily executed" by the Israelis -- makes the&#160;U.S. Government's silence here all the more appalling.&#160; One of the prime duties of a government is to safeguard the welfare of its own citizens.&#160;&#160;It's inconceivable for most governments in the world to remain silent in the face of formal findings that a foreign nation "summarily executed" one of its own citizens.&#160; One of the reasons Turkey was so emphatic in its condemnation of Israel was because the dead were Turkish citizens; that's what governments do when a foreign nation kills its own citizens. &#160;Yet not only does the U.S. Government sit silently, but its prior statements <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/jun/02/joe-biden-israel-gaza-flotilla-raid"><strong>defending</strong> Israel were disgustingly cavalier</a>.&#160; Virtually the entire world -- literally -- <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/world/middleeast/01flotilla.html">vehemently condemned Israel</a> for what it did here, yet the&#160;U.S. refused and continues to refuse to do so, notwithstanding these findings that one of its own citizens was essentially murdered.</p>
  <p>Perhaps most illustrative of all is how inconceivable it is to imagine the U.S. Congress doing anything at all in the face of this report . . . . except passing a Resolution condemning the investigators themselves while defending Israeli actions, including the actions that resulted in the death of an American teenager.&#160; Is there any doubt that such a Resolution would pass with overwhelming bipartisan support, approaching unanimity -- as happens <a href="http://www.alternet.org/world/119252/virtually_the_entire_dem-controlled_congress_supports_israel%27s_war_crimes_in_gaza/">each</a> and <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0610/Large_majorities_on_Hill_back_Israels_flotilla_raid.html">every</a> time <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-house-backs-resolution-to-condemn-goldstone-gaza-report-1.4853">there is a controversy</a> involving Israel? &#160;&#160;Thus far, the U.S. media and Government are largely silent about this U.N. Report, but if they are prodded into responding, the response will almost certainly be to condemn the report itself while defending and justifying Israeli actions even in the face of overwhelming evidence as to what really happened here, which managed to emerge despite the&#160;Israelis' very telling efforts to keep it suppressed.</p>
  <p>*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>
  <p>In not unrelated news, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/143294/Approval-Gains-Nearly-Erased-Middle-East-North-Africa.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines%20-%20Presidential%20Job%20Approval%20-%20World">a new Gallup survey</a> of numerous Middle Eastern and North African nations finds that public opinion of the&#160;U.S. and its political leadership has collapsed back to Bush-era levels.&#160; That is consistent with <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/08/05/muslims">prior polls in the Muslim world finding the same thing</a>.&#160;&#160;One of the central, stated goals of the&#160;Obama campaign and his presidency was improving how that part of the world perceives of the&#160;United States, on the ground that widespread anti-American sentiment is what fuels Terrorism and endangers Americans around the world. &#160;That effort is clearly failing.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;Just to get a sense for how little attention has been paid to the killing of this American teenager by Israel, contrast how much media attention was devoted to mourning the Iranian Government's killing of Neda Agha-Soltan with the attention paid to&#160;Dogan. &#160;A NEXIS search for "Neda and Iran" produces this:</p>

<description>The U.S. increases its efforts to apprehend war criminals. . . . provided they're not American</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below - Update II)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>It doesn't happen often, but sometimes, something you read is so magnificent on its own that there is nothing to say about it.&#160; <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-10-01-warcriminals01_ST_N.htm?csp=34news">This <em>USA&#160;Today</em> article</a>, proudly touting the increased efforts of the U.S. Government to track down and punish war criminals (provided, of course, that they're not American), is one such example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>War criminals find it's harder to hide from past, U.S. agents</strong>
    </p>
    <p>When federal agents finally caught up with Gilberto Jordan, he had all the trappings of a solid American life: a house in a tidy South Florida neighborhood, steady work as a chef and a spotless record as a law-abiding citizen since emigrating from Guatemala in the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>Nothing suggested he was hiding from a horrific past that the agents attributed to him when they knocked on his door that day in May. He still used the same name that appeared on a decade-old order for his arrest on murder charges in his native country. . . .</p>
    <p>The prosecution of Jordan, 54, underscores <strong>a new push by federal law enforcement agencies to hunt down war criminals and human rights abusers who have found refuge in the United States.</strong></p>
    <p>The agents that tracked him are from a special center that Immigration and Customs created last year to bolster its work on such cases.</p>
    <p>When Jordan pleaded guilty this summer to participating in the [1982] Dos Erres massacre, it marked the first conviction won by a new, 50-person Justice Department office set up to prosecute them.</p>
    <p>The targets range from African despots and military officers from the former Yugoslavia to lesser-known figures, such as Jordan. It's unclear how many are out there, but officials at Justice's Human Rights and Special Prosecutions office say they're tracking multiple suspects. <strong>Armed with new investigative tools, more legal powers and a beefed-up congressional mandate, they're charging culprits at an unprecedented rate.</strong></p>
    <p>Convicted offenders usually are deported, sometimes after a U.S. prison stint. Many end up being turned over to authorities in countries where they face charges for war crimes or human rights abuses.</p>
    <p>"I don't think there's any question that we're going to have a greater number of these cases and that these cases are going to reach (suspects from) more parts of the world," says Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, a child of Holocaust survivors who has pushed the more aggressive efforts to hold war criminals accountable. <strong>"It's something we have to do. We owe it to our citizens and we owe it to the world."</strong></p>
    <p>Congress passed the laws amid a broader international push after the Cold War to hold war criminals and human rights abusers accountable, says Eli Rosenbaum, who ran the Office of Special Investigations and now is director of strategy and policy in the new Human Rights and Special Prosecutions unit.</p>
    <p>"Interest burgeoned all over the world in bringing these people to justice," Rosenbaum says. Among U.S. policymakers, "there was bipartisan support for doing this, and Congress gave us a lot of new tools."</p>
    <p>Now, it's going full steam.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>"We want to send a message to would-be human rights violators of the future," Rosenbaum says. "Their odds of getting away with it are shrinking rapidly."<br /></strong>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I&#160;love that Lanny Breuer&#160;quote so much that I&#160;just need to repeat it: &#160;"It's something we have to do. We owe it to our citizens and we owe it to the world."&#160; And that Rosenbaum quote seems grounded in the premise that -- imagine this -- war crimes become more likely in the future, become virtually inevitable, if "would-be human rights violators" know they can&#160;"get away with it."&#160; This, from a country that actually placed as&#160;a Judge on its second-highest federal court level one of the prime legal architects of its worldwide torture regime, and which <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/19/jay-bybee-nyt-calls-for-i_n_188680.html">blithely leaves him there</a> even as more evidence emerges of the central role he played in enabling it, and whose <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/16/obama-on-spanish-torture_n_187710.html">top political leader formally adopts a position of full immunity for its own war criminals</a>.&#160; My duties as a citizen compel me to help this new, muscular DOJ&#160;War Crimes unit by pointing <a href="http://maps.google.com.br/maps?hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=575&amp;q=crawford,+texas&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Crawford,+TX,+USA&amp;gl=br&amp;ei=vbilTMvZJIG88gbg0qyLAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ8gEwAA">to one place where they haven't yet looked</a>&#160;(<strong>update</strong>:&#160;&#160;many vigilant citizens noted that this particular, un-apprehened war criminal is on the move, and is now located <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Daria+Place,+Dallas,+TX&amp;sll=32.904992,-96.815965&amp;sspn=0.016016,0.020921&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Daria+Pl,+Dallas,+Texas+75229&amp;ll=32.884953,-96.81118&amp;spn=0.004005,0.00523&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=32.884807,-96.811736&amp;panoid=7496GtqlnBbzDmJU5oIqHQ&amp;cbp=12,239.52,,0,-6.45">here</a>).</p>

<description>A partial defense of Obama's assassination program highlights the corrupted rationale that justifies it</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below -&#160;Update II [Friday] - Update III [Reply from and to Sullivan])</strong>
  </p>
  <p><a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/09/the-power-to-kill-american-citizens.html">Andrew Sullivan quotes from</a> an <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/alexmassie/6313624/obamas-hit-squad-above-and-beyond-the-law.thtml">excellent column by Alex Massie in <em>The Spectator</em></a>. &#160;Massie points to Obama's assassination program and writes: "you can make an argument that Obama's actions are worse than Bush's since a) he wasn't charged with cobbling together a security framework in the confused, panicked aftermath of 9/11 and b) he actually, you know, once campaigned against quite a lot of this stuff."&#160; Andrew, basically objecting to Massie's claim, makes several points in response that merit attention and, at least for me, prompt various questions. &#160;Andrew:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>But a single American al Qaeda terrorist in a foreign country actively waging war against us seems to me to be a pretty isolated example.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><strong>First</strong></u>, Awlaki is most certainly not a singular case.&#160; Obama's "hit list" has at least four&#160;Americans on it; Awlaki is the only one whose identity we know. &#160;From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/26/AR2010012604239_2.html?hpid=topnews&amp;sid=ST2010012700394"><em>The Washington Post</em>'s Dana Priest in January</a>:&#160;&#160;"After the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush gave the CIA, and later the military, authority to kill U.S. citizens abroad . . . . The Obama administration has adopted the same stance. . . . . As of several months ago, <strong>the CIA list included three U.S. citizens, and an intelligence official said that Aulaqi's name has now been added</strong>."</p>
  <p><strong><u>Second</u></strong>, could Andrew please explain how he knows that Awlaki is an "al Qaeda terrorist"?&#160; Being an "al Qaeda terrorist" is a crime with which many people have been charged and convicted. &#160;But Awlaki never has been. &#160;Are the untested, leaked accusations from government officials really enough for Andrew to conclude that an American citizen is a "terrorist" and, accordingly, support the imposition of the death penalty? &#160;Does Andrew not need or want to see any actual evidence -- let alone have that evidence subjected to due process and checks and balances -- before simply assuming and asserting that an accusation like that is true? &#160;Does the <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/07/08/97211/federal-judge-order-release-of.html">lengthy record of error and/or abuse under both Bush and Obama -- whereby countless people have been <strong>falsely</strong> accused of being Terrorists</a> -- not preclude a rational person from vesting blind faith in unchecked government accusations of this sort?&#160;&#160;</p>
  <p><strong><u>Third</u></strong>, the "just an isolated case" defense was frequently invoked by Bush supporters.&#160;&#160;There were "only two" American citizens detained for years without charges by the Bush administration -- Jose Padilla and Yaser Hamdi.&#160; Did that make the assertion of that tyrannical power more acceptable to Andrew?&#160;&#160;The claim at the time from those of us who vehemently opposed it was that if you endorse what is being done to those two individuals, then by necessity you've vested the&#160;President with the power to detain Americans without charges or due process -- not just the current President but future ones as well. &#160;Isn't that same concern exactly applicable to Obama's asserted assassination power, no matter how many individuals --at the moment -- are targeted?&#160; And can Andrew point to a single, similar awesome power seized by political leaders on the ground of "war" that did not end up being severely abused when it was exercised in the dark?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I agree that invoking state secrets so comprehensively as to prevent any scrutiny of this is a step way too far.&#160;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But given that they have invoked this, and have thus shrouded their case against Awlaki in total secrecy, why is Andrew willing to assert that Awlaki is a terrorist, and not only assert it, but do so with such conviction that he's comfortable with the death penalty being imposed based on nothing more than unchecked Presidential decree?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>But I do believe we are at war; and that killing those who wish to kill us before they can do so is not the equivalent of "assassination".&#160;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Are we "at war" on the entire planet -- <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2005/11/caught_on_the_b.html">the centerpiece of the Bush/Cheney assertion of radical powers</a> -- or are there physical limits to where the&#160;President's war powers apply, <u>i.e.</u>, where the "battlefield" is? &#160;If we're "at war" anywhere and everywhere Terrorists are found, does that apply to U.S. soil?&#160;&#160;Can Obama also order American citizens killed without due process on U.S. soil if he accuses them of being members of Al Qaeda?&#160; What possible coherent limits could one assert to deny that power?&#160;&#160;And is merely harboring a "wish" to "kill us" sufficient to make someone a Terrorist, or do they actually have to take affirmative steps to harm Americans?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>My concern has always been with the power to detain without due process and torture, not the regrettable necessity of killing the enemy in a hot and dangerous war.&#160;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is the claim I have long found most confounding. &#160;In what conceivable moral or legal universe is it intolerable merely to <strong>detain</strong> someone without due process -- something Bush did to great controversy and outrage -- but acceptable to <strong>kill</strong> them without due process? &#160;Given that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/20/AR2008112001714.html">wrongful due-process-free detention can be corrected</a>, whereas wrongful due-process-free killing cannot be, isn't the former far more acceptable than the latter?&#160;&#160;Also recall that Bush's mere <strong>eavesdropping</strong> on Americans without due process or oversight caused a major national scandal; it's true that&#160;Bush's eavesdropping was illegal, but it was also claimed to be so dangerous because it lacked any oversight:&#160;&#160;how can Obama's <strong>killing</strong> of American citizens without due process or oversight possibly be more tolerable than Bush's mere eavesdropping?&#160;&#160;</p>
  <p>Also, the language Andrew uses -- "a hot and dangerous war" -- implies that the person being targeted is involved in some sort of active hostilities at the time we kill him. &#160;But that's not the case. &#160;The kill order permits them to be targeted no matter what they are doing at the moment the drone lands on their head:&#160;&#160;sleeping, playing with their children, riding in a car with their parents, anything else far away from a battlefield.&#160;&#160;Besides torture, if the&#160;President has the authority to order American citizens killed without a shred of due process under those circumstances, what doesn't he have the power to do provided he simply accuses them of being an Al Qaeda Terrorist?&#160;&#160;I spent years <a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2005/12/do-bush-defenders-place-any-limits-on_22.html">asking that question during the Bush/Cheney era without getting an answer</a> --&#160;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/16/AR2006011600779.html">Al Gore asked the same question in 2006</a>: &#160;"under the theory by which these acts are committed, are there any acts that can on their face be prohibited?" -- and sadly, the question is every bit as relevant now.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;I&#160;have one other question for Andrew: &#160;one of the rhetorical questions frequently posed to Bush supporters was this one:&#160;&#160;<em>with regard to all of these unchecked powers which you're now endorsing, would you feel equally comfortable having them exercised by a Democratic President; would you be happy with, say, Hillary Clinton having the power to eavesdrop on or even detain American</em> <em>citizens with no due process, purely on her own unilateral decree?</em>&#160;&#160;Would Andrew be comfortable with a future Republican&#160;President -- let's say, just to pick a random example . . . . President Sarah Palin -- having the power to order American citizens killed based solely on her unchecked accusation that they are somehow involved with or helping Al Qaeda Terrorists, while the targeted citizens have no recourse to any courts and she has no obligation to offer any evidence to justify the targeting?</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE&#160;II</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;Last night, <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/09/answers-for-glenn-greenwald.html">Andrew wrote</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Answers For Glenn Greenwald</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Just a quick word to say that I hope to respond to his excellent questions very soon - it's just been a busy day on the personal front and I didn't want to dash off a response unworthy of the challenge. I also had a column to write today - the one you can't read any more without paying for it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I appreciate that and look forward to the responses.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE&#160;III</strong></u>:&#160;Sullivan's reply to this post is <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/10/answers-for-glenn-greenwald.html">here</a>, and my response to that is <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/02/assassinations/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<description>Sanctions imposed today by the U.S. on Iranians reveal a rather glaring double standard</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>For many people, one of the earliest and gravest disappointments in Barack Obama was his announcement that those who implemented a worldwide torture regime <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html">should not be punished in any way</a>, because <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/16/obama-on-spanish-torture_n_187710.html">we must Look&#160;Forward, Not Backward</a>.&#160; He even <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/23/mcchrystal-survived-tillm_n_622919.html">chose a General neck-deep in detainee abuse</a> to lead his war in Afghanistan, and chose a Bush-era CIA&#160;official who <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2008/11/16/brennan">endorsed many "enhanced interrogation techniques"</a> as his top Terrorism adviser.&#160; Torture and other crimes was something to be forgiven and swept entirely under the rug.&#160; Obama now appears to view such matters differently . . . . <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/09/29/us/politics/AP-US-US-Iran.html?_r=2&amp;hp">at least when the torturers are Iranian rather than American</a>&#160;(h/t&#160;<a href="http://twitter.com/Atrios/status/25907862812">Atrios</a>):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Obama administration on Wednesday placed eight Iranian officials on a U.S. financial blacklist, saying they were <strong>responsible for beatings, killings and torture</strong> following Iran's disputed presidential election last year.</p>
    <p>The Treasury and State departments jointly announced that the sanctions, signed by President Barack Obama, target Iranians who <strong>"share responsibility for the sustained and severe violation of human rights in Iran."</strong></p>
    <p>At a State Department news conference, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said this is the first time the United States has imposed sanctions on Iranians for human rights violations.</p>
    <p>"On these officials' watch or under their command, <strong>Iranian citizens have been arbitrarily arrested, beaten, tortured, raped, blackmailed and killed,</strong>" Clinton said. "Yet the Iranian government has ignored repeated calls from the international community to end these abuses."</p>
    <p>Obama's order blocks any U.S. assets of the eight Iranians and prohibits Americans from doing business with them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Numerous detainees in American custody were also beaten, tortured <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/06/30/accountability">and killed</a>.&#160; The photos Obama caused to be suppressed -- even after two federal courts ordered them disclosed -- <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/05/28/report-iraq-abuse-photos-rape-torture/">depicted multiple acts of detainee rape</a>.&#160; Thousands were arbitrarily arrested and detained by the U.S. without due process, and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/05/no-habeas-at-bagram/">continue to be</a>.&#160; None of that resulted in a smidgen of accountability for the high-level government officials responsible for all of that, because the Obama administration formally took the position that they should be immunized.&#160; Somehow, though, the same Obama officials manage with a straight face to stand up in public and impose penalties on Iranians for the same conduct.&#160; Note, too, how freely the Associated Press uses the word "torture" to describe what the&#160;Iranians did, in contrast to <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/06/30/media/index.html">the American media's refusal to use that term for what Americans did</a>. &#160;</p>
  <p>Can you believe those crazy, paranoid Muslims and&#160;Arabs who claim that the&#160;U.S. maintains completely different standards for itself and the rest of the world?&#160; Such deranged, conspiratorial thoughts can mean only one thing:&#160;&#160;They Hate Us For Our Freedom.</p>
  <p>*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;</p>
  <p>Uganda today <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201009290177.html">implemented a supposedly "controversial" new eavesdropping law</a> "giving powers to security officials to listen into private communication if they have sufficient reason to suspect the communication is in aid of criminal activity"; requiring "telecom companies [] to give government security agencies cooperation to place their (agencies') tapping gadgets on their network equipment with the aim of enabling the security men access private conversations or exchanges"; and "makes it compulsory for all mobile phone users in the country to register their SIM cards for security purposes such that if a sim card is used for criminal communication and coordination, the user can be traced."&#160;&#160;It's interesting that this law is deemed "controversial" given that its safeguards are far greater than what Americans enjoy&#160;under the FISA&#160;Amendments Act of 2008 supported by Obama ("according to the [Ugandan] law, only a High Court judge can grant permission to a state security operative to tap into a person's communication"). &#160;I&#160;wonder if the State Department tomorrow will issue a stinging condemnation of Uganda's tyrannical new eavesdropping powers.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;<em>Harper</em>'s&#160;Washington Editor, the excellent journalist Ken Silverstein, is leaving his position and explains what it is about Washington that led him to his decision.&#160; <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2010/09/hbc-90007662">It is short and well worth reading</a>.</p>

Obama</em>, the lawsuit brought by Anwar Awlaki's father seeking a court order enjoining the President from assassinating his son with no due process.&#160; The Obama DOJ raised numerous arguments, all of which were grounded in the claim that courts have no role whatsoever to play in interfering with the President's decisions over who to assassinate as part of the "War on Terror."&#160;&#160;Along with several others, I&#160;focused on the DOJ's invocation of the "state secret" privilege because that was most viscerally horrifying:&#160; the very idea that the&#160;President claims the right not only to order Americans killed with no due process, but to do so in total secrecy beyond the reach of the courts, is -- as <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2010/09/27/tyranny/">Radley Balko</a> and&#160;<a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=09&amp;year=2010&amp;base_name=theres_a_portion_in_the">Jamelle Bouie</a> note -- as tyrannical a claim as we've heard in the last decade.</p>
  <p>But beyond "state secrets," there were several other equally dubious, dangerous and Bush-replicating arguments raised by the&#160;Obama DOJ&#160;to immunize itself from judicial review.&#160;&#160;Included among them was a claim that Awlaki's father lacks "standing" to bring this lawsuit because (a) he cannot prove that the&#160;U.S. Government is trying to kill his son and (b)&#160;Awlaki himself could sue if he wanted to.&#160;&#160;The&#160;DOJ also argues that, as a result of the AUMF, it is for the&#160;President alone -- not the courts -- to decide who can and should be killed as part of the War on Terror.</p>
  <p>My guests today on <em>Salon Radio</em> to discuss these claims are Ben Wizner of the ACLU and Pardiss&#160;Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights, both of whom are representing Awlaki in this lawsuit.&#160;&#160;I&#160;posed to them all of the arguments I've heard from Obama supporters over the past few days to "justify" this due-process-free assassination program, and also asked them to explain the arguments raised by the Obama DOJ&#160;in its defense. &#160;The discussion is roughly 20 minutes long, and I&#160;really urge anyone interested in this issue to listen.&#160; Both Wizner and&#160;Kebriaei are extremely clear and informative, and everyone can make up their own minds about whether there is any remote justification -- legal, Constitutional, ethical, political or moral -- for Obama to do what he's doing here.</p>

<description>Increasing vitriolic attacks on dissatisfied Democrats are quite unlikely to inspire greater enthusiasm</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
  <p>
    <strong>(updated below -&#160;Update&#160;II)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>President Obama gave <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/209395?RS_show_page=6">an interview to <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> and actually said this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The idea that we've got a lack of enthusiasm in the Democratic base, that people are sitting on their hands complaining, is just irresponsible. . . . .<strong>If we want the kind of country that respects civil rights and civil liberties, we'd better fight in this election.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This may be one of the most audaciously hilarious political statements&#160;I've read in quite some time.&#160; The Holder Justice Department's <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=09&amp;year=2009&amp;base_name=republicans_disappointed_in_ho">record on domestic civil rights enforcement</a> is actually one of the few areas where there has been substantial improvement -- and that's a perfectly legitimate argument to make -- but for Barack Obama to cite "civil liberties" as a reason why Democratic apathy is "just irresponsible," and to claim with a straight face that this election will determine whether we're "the kind of country that respects" them, is so detached from basic reality that I actually had to read this three or four times to make certain&#160;I hadn't misunderstood it.&#160; To summarize Obama's apparent claim:&#160;&#160;the&#160;Republicans better not win in the midterm election, otherwise we'll have due-process-free and even preventive detention, secret assassinations of U.S. citizens, vastly expanded government surveillance of the Internet, a continuation of Guantanamo, protection of Executive branch crimes through the use of radical secrecy doctrines, escalating punishment for whistleblowers, legal immunity for war crimes, and a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/world/asia/28drones.html?hp">massively escalated drone war in Pakistan</a>.&#160; That's why, as the President inspirationally warns us:&#160; "If we want the kind of country that respects civil liberties, we'd better fight in this election."</p>
  <p>Speaking of inspirational messaging, Vice&#160;President Joe Biden <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39395081/ns/politics-white_house/">yesterday said</a> we must "remind our base constituency to <strong>stop whining</strong>."&#160; Last week, <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/09/president-obamas-message-to-griping-and-groaning-democrats.html">Obama condemned</a> "Democrats <strong>griping and groaning</strong>," and the day before he <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/09/17/obama">mocked Democrats</a> who "just congenitally, tend to get -- to see the glass as half empty." &#160;That, of course, was preceded by <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/08/robert-gibbs-and-drug-testing/">Robert Gibbs announcing</a> that liberal critics of the&#160;President who complain about continuation of&#160;Bush policies "need to get drug tested," while&#160;Rahm Emanuel had <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703808904575025030384695158.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines#printMode">previously shared his view</a> that dissatisfied liberals are "fucking retarded."&#160;&#160;Echoing those sentiments almost verbatim, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-09-24/get-off-your-asses-liberals/">Matt Yglesias called this week in <em>The&#160;Daily Beast</em></a> for a "<strong>little less whining and a little more cheerleading from the left</strong>," and accused those who fail to comply of "self-pity and self-indulgence" on the ground that the enthusiasm gap could jeopardize gains in health care coverage.</p>
  <p>Obama supporters often claim that those who object to this White House messaging are reacting emotionally and personally because they're "offended" by these criticisms.&#160; Speaking only for myself, that has nothing to do with any of this.&#160; I'm not the slightest bit "offended" when Obama officials and their apparatchiks voice these accusations. &#160;They have the same right to condemn their critics as their critics have to condemn them, and it's hardly a surprise that Obama officials harbor these thoughts about the "left."&#160;&#160;Contempt for the left is one of the unifying beliefs of the&#160;Washington establishment, which is why most conventional establishment journalists --&#160;<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/print/maureen-dowd-robert-gibbs-was-right-about-the-professional-left/">Maureen Dowd</a>,&#160;<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/08/robert_gibbs_was_right_to_crit.html">Ruth Marcus</a>, <a href="http://www.fair.org/blog/2010/08/12/milbank-on-robert-gibbs-and-the-professional-left/">Dana Milbank</a> -- cheered Gibbs' outburst about the&#160;"Professional&#160;Left."&#160; None of that is new; none of it is a surprise; and none of it is "offensive."</p>
  <p>What is notable about it is what it reveals <strong>substantively</strong>.&#160; The country is drowning in a severe and worsening unemployment crisis.&#160;&#160;People are losing their homes by the millions.&#160; Income inequality continues to explode while the last vestiges of middle class security continue to erode. &#160;The&#160;Obama civil liberties record has been nothing short of a disgrace, usually equaling and sometimes surpassing the worst of the Bush/Cheney abuses.&#160; We have to stand by and watch the&#160;Commander-in-Chief fire one gay service member after the next for their sexual orientation.&#160; The major bills touted by Obama supporters were the by-product of the very corporatist/lobbyist dominance which Obama the candidate repeatedly railed against.&#160; Rather than take responsibility for any of this, they instead dismiss criticisms and objections as petulant, childish, "irresponsible whining" -- signaling rather clearly that they think they're doing the right thing and that these criticisms are fundamentally unfair.&#160;</p>
  <p><strong>That</strong> is what makes these reactions significant:&#160;&#160; not that anyone's feelings are hurt by the name-calling, but that they believe that this record merits <strong>gratitude</strong> rather than valid condemnation, and that anger over the state of the country is nothing more than irresponsible whining.&#160; It's fine to tout accomplishments and try to unify the base behind them -- it's election season and they ought to be doing that -- but it's just mystifying that they think they're going to accomplish anything other than feeling better about themselves with these incessant, name-calling attacks on those who are dissatisfied with their behavior -- <strong>their policies</strong> -- in power.&#160; Talk about "self-pitying and self-indulgent."&#160; It's just amazing to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/us/18labor.html">read about how union members are reluctant to work for Democratic victory because of the economic suffering they are experiencing</a> -- or how <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/11/nation/la-na-obama-coalition-20100912">young, first-time and minority voters see little reason to work for Democrats</a> -- and then hear Joe Biden dismiss those concerns as "whining" and&#160;Obama deride them as "irresponsible."&#160;&#160;Democratic voters aren't unenthusiastic because they're reading too much blog criticism of the&#160;President; they're apathetic because they see what has happened in their own lives over the past 2 years and see little reason to work for those who have been in power during that time.</p>
  <p>And it's even more baffling that they seem to believe that insulting their disappointed supporters -- rather than addressing the source of their critiques or, even better, doing something about them -- will generate enthusiasm to go vote. &#160;As the very same <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/08/robert-gibbs-and-drug-testing/">Matt Yglesias wrote in the wake of the&#160;Gibbs' controversy</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I think Robert Gibbs needs to be drug tested if he thinks whining about liberal critics in an interview with The Hill is going to help him or Barack Obama in any way.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The same must be true of Obama and Biden using increasingly strident and petulant language to condemn those who are deeply dissatisfied with their performance in office. &#160;It's difficult to imagine Obama and his aides attacking the Democratic base this way if it were Obama running for re-election.&#160; Obama officials aren't stupid:&#160; they must know that insulting disaffected Democrats and deriding their concerns as "whining" is not an effective get-out-the-vote strategy.&#160;</p>
  <p>What's going on here seems clear.&#160; Each time there is a Democratic loss on the horizon, White House officials find someone to blame other than Obama; that happened with Martha Coakley, Creigh Deeds, and a whole slew of other Democratic defeats.&#160; By incessantly complaining now about the "irresponsible" "whiners"&#160;who aren't sufficiently grateful to the&#160;Obama White House, they seem to be setting up in advance a nice excuse for Democratic defeat in November:&#160;&#160; <em>it wasn't anything we did to cause this; it was the fault of those whiny, unrealistic irresponsible liberals who didn't cheerlead loudly enough</em>.&#160; &#160;What seems to matter most is that Obama be exonerated for the Democrats' electoral woes, even though he clearly bears substantial responsibility for much of it.</p>

  <p>The&#160;finalists for the 2010 Online&#160;Journalism Awards -- sponsored by the Online News Association and the School of Communication at the University of Miami -- <a href="http://journalists.org/news/49830/Finalists-for-the-2010-Online-Journalism-Awards-announced.htm">were announced today</a>.&#160; <em>Salon</em> was named a finalist for "General Excellence in Online Journalism, Medium Site," while I was named a finalist (along with Kevin Drum)&#160;for "Online Commentary/Blogging, Medium Site" (for these three posts:&#160;&#160;<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/04/05/afghanistan">one on Afghanistan</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/06/18/wikileaks">one on Bradley&#160;Manning/WikiLeaks</a>, and <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/04/13/kagan/index.html">one on Elena Kagan</a>).&#160; As the announcement notes:&#160;&#160;"A team of 12 journalists representing a diverse cross-section of the industry met at the university's Coral Gables, Fla., campus and seven more conferred internationally to select the finalists, which range from independent and nonprofit news and community sites to major media and international organizations. The winners will be announced at the 2010 ONA Conference and Online Journalism Awards Banquet on Saturday, Oct. 30, at the Marriott Renaissance in Washington, D.C."</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;David&#160;Dayen has <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2010/09/28/has-the-white-house-lost-their-minds/">an excellent post on all of this</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I would just add that I've never seen a politician run an election with the message "Don&#8217;t be stupid, quit your bitching and vote for me."&#160; This goes orders of magnitude beyond "Here are the stakes, my opponent would vote against everything you care about."&#160; That at least has a certain time-tested quality.&#160; That would make the election a choice and not a referendum.&#160; But "vote for me, you simpletons"?&#160; There's a reason that strategy has never been employed: because it's so insane to think that open berating would inspire a voter to action.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Read Dayen's whole post, as he also analyzes Obama's civil liberties "defense" in that <em>Rolling&#160;Stone</em> interview.&#160;&#160; Also well worth reading is <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2010/09/27/late-night-stop-whining-liberals/">Blue Texan's critique of the White House's base-directed messaging</a>, and suggestions for how it could be vastly improved.</p>
  <p>&#160;</p>
  <p><u><strong>UPDATE&#160;II</strong></u>:&#160;&#160;<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/09/dear_white_house_heres_how.html">Greg Sargent</a> and&#160;<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_09/025885.php">Steve&#160;Benen</a> both have smart, nuanced discussions of this controversy, and in particular draw important distinctions between the various factions of "critics on the Left," who are often misleadingly lumped in together.&#160; Along those lines, Jane Hamsher -- always relevant to the WH v. Leftist critics discussion -- has her own <a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/09/28/hectoring-the-base-its-not-about-gotv-its-about-laying-the-blame/">insightful reaction to the&#160;administration's recent comments</a>.</p>
